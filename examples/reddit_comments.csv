The dude knows his shit. Activley will callout his own mistakes during the following episodes when he is wrong(which isnt often) He tells it in weay better than any textbook. He almost never goes off the rails and talsk about irrelevant material. And when he doies its about baseball for like 4 seconds. He enjoys the topic and you can tell."

15,"My all time favorite is The Film Reroll. They take the basic premise of a film and play through the story as an RPG, allowing the choices of the players and roll of the dice to drastically change the story. Highlights have included starting a civil war in Oz, blowing up the moon in ET, and the GM tricking the players into thinking they were doing an obscure 80's teen sex comedy none of them had ever heard of only to spring Jason on them and reveal it was really Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter.

Here are a couple clips for a taste:

[The Cowardly Lion worries about what happened to Dorothy and Scarecrow when the party got split](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0aXazjuGmg)  

[Jafar fails a will roll and falls in love with Aladdin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKccujh0WVU)

They will sometimes do sequels to their previous rerolls and those can get epic. Their version of the Halloween trilogy is my personal canonical version of that franchise to me. Danny Hodges is the greatest ascended NPC protagonist the movies never had. Currently they're doing Rogue Two. In their version of Rogue One, Andor, Jyn, and K2SO all survived so now their continued story is running parallel to A New Hope.

I could go on and on about the running jokes, the great humor, the unexpectedly dramatic moments with real pathos, the wonderful personalities and absolutely world class acting and improv that goes into the show. I dearly love it and have listened to every episode at least twice, while some of my favorites have become go-to comfort listening and I've lost count of how many times I've relistened to those. But I'll let ya'll discover all of that for yourselves. It's a true gem of a show.

Some honorable mentions:

Oh No! Ross and Carrie: They examine ""fringe science, spirituality, and claims of the paranormal"" and ""show up so you don't have to."" They try alternative medicines on themselves, join cults, and investigate all kind of wild claims and report back their first hand experience. Yes, they have done Scientology. You might be surprised at how far into it they got before they were found out.

Monster Talk: a show that looks at Fortean phenomenon from a skeptical perspective. Never cynical or simply debunking, they engage with every topic like there could be some merit until they find that there isn't any. Good research and even worse puns.

In Research Of: A sort of spin off form Monster Talk, they watch every episode of the classic Leonard Nimoy series In Search Of and ""present some explanations that the producers chose not to present."" One of the co-hosts is an Archaeologist, and it can be a hoot to hear him go off on ancient alien and Graham Hancock type shit.

Another Path: A D&D 5e Actual Play podcast. They had a pretty epic campaign that I'd recommend for fans of The Adventure Zone. They recently started a new one with new characters that doesn't require listening to the old one, although the old one is well worth the time.

Imprinted Echoes: A Numenera actual play podcast. Has some neat sci-fi concepts in it and I love the crew playing it."
16,"This is actually happening - each episode is about an experience someone really had and is told in their own voice. For example, one episode is about how a woman survived an apartment fire, another is about a woman who hit and accidentally killed a person on the road.

The writers for that show do insanely indepth research with some even going so far as to reach out to and interview people involved in the cases. There was an episode about some famous bank robber in I believe Hong Kong named Yip Kai Foon where the writer for the episode, who was local, was able to get copies of original police reports and sit down with officers involved in hunting him down. The guy did so much work for a single podcast episode he ended up publishing a damn book on the guy.

I can't even put my finger on their weird brand of humor but its just friends  being stupid, discussing problems and making bad puns.

Sadly after a decade of recordings and 550+ episodes, they finally called it quits and put an end to it because 3 of the 5 members had kids.

Let me put it this way, it was one of the only things I subbed to their Patreon for a monthly bill just for an extra episode when I didn't even see the value of paying for a monthly phone service bill.

Other than that, Suff You Should Know is ok but they get sidetracked way too easily.

156,"Ear Buiscuits with Rhett and Link from Good Mythical Morning. It originally started with them interviewing different influential YouTubers about how they got into their particular passions, started their channels, etc. and was pretty insightful in that regard.

However, it has become a podcast where the two of them basically just talk about whatever and share their thoughts and feelings about random stuff. I recently just finished their sets of episodes about their spiritual deconstruction stories, and it was very incredible and interesting. They are very funny (if you are into their kind of humor), insightful, genuine, and overall just seem like awesome guys, and it really shows in the podcast."
157,"I'd like to make a case for mine. I have taken some pieces I've researched and written over the last few years and turned them into a podcast.

If you are interested in how not only humans came to use fire but how we became dependent on it I have an episode called ""The Forging of Humanity"" about that. 

I also have a 12 part series called ""God in the Frontier"" where I researched some pretty extreme religious movements in Western NY. Some had a huge national and international impact like the Rochester revivals of 1830 by Charles Grandson Finney which changed the way the country worshiped and played a role in starting the first 3rd party of the US - the Anti Masonic Party; or like Spiritualism which started from 3 young girls outside of Rochester who claimed they could talk to the dead only to have one of them do a public speech that they had lied about it many years later but it was so popular people just called her a liar, even Harry Houdini tried to stand up against it in Congress and he was accused of being a secret spiritualist in front of the entire country on public record; or like Mormonism and Joseph Smith's increasingly desperate efforts to stay out of legal trouble as he moved further west. There was Millerism where people thought they knew when the end of the world would be and so they actually sold their belongings around the country and waited for the day that never came; or there is the Oneida Community and their strange open sexual practices with each other. I'm currently releasing this series.

And then if you like space, I seriously got you covered with a 29 part series next which will include a lot of cool ways in which space has impacted is subtly and not so subtly including an eclipse that stopped a war, how the sky looked different to our ancestors, how climate change impacted human evolution, and what it's like to be a meteorite hunter.

If you find this interesting just check out my profile!"
158,"I really enjoy The Adventure Zone. I have some of my perspective about it below.

I also really enjoyed:

 Hello Internet, while it was going on, but for now it is dead. It's part of the ""Two guys talking "" genre and isn't about anything in particular.

Saw Bones, a medical history comedy podcasts. It's generally about all the crazy stupid things we did to each other in the name of medicine and science throughout history. It's hosted by a husband wife combo, wife is an actual Medical Doctor, husband is the eldest of the McElroy brothers. They try a little bit too hard of the comedy sometimes for the openers and stuff like that, but overall the show is generally informative and funny whenever they're not actually trying to be funny. I would scan through the topics and see if any catch your eye.






The Adventure Zone is a DND play podcast where the three McElroy brothers and their dad do some pretty good stuff.

I can only fully recommend ""Balance"" the first campaign which they call ""Arcs"" I think. It's a slow burn at first but if you stick with it, the pay off is incredible.. Initially they're just goofing around and trying to figure out what they are trying to do, but then things take a real foothold and a very interesting and emotional story blossoms) I never felt so many emotions about a fictional story let alone a podcast.

The second full arc of Amnesty is a personal favorite, being that I'm from the area it's happening it,  but it has mixed reception for a few reasons. Some of the less contentious ones are that they are playing a different game system and that it's not fantasy, it's somewhat based in real life but with a  supernatural twist."

The narrative stories run the gambit between horror, suspense, and comedy. The informatives are weird facts and The Moth is well known and played on the radio over npr. No sleep isn't great, but if you want good voice work and a consecutive year of media to binge, it's got 18 seasons and a few choice stories.

212,"Adeptus Ridiculous. Ever hear about Warhammer 40k? Ever look at it and go ""I don't understand any of this."" Adeptus Ridiculous is a podcast involving technically three people: DK, Bricky, and Quiet Shy (the editor). It's all about Bricky teaching DK about the lore of Warhammer 40k in a condensed, easily digestible way, often times with some memes thrown in either intentionally or by accident. 

For real though, I was already decently informed about the lore with a lot of gaps here and there, then I found this podcast and it helped me understand a lot more things about Warhammer 40k and has actually gotten me excited about future upcoming lore even though I don't play the tabletop. Highly recommended."

By Ryan Graves, a former Navy fighter pilot. He talks about UAPs. His guests that are fellow pilots are super interesting. 

Episode 3 is probably the most interesting and not for the UAPs. He talks with another fighter pilot who survived an insane crash. They talk UAPs like for 10-20% of that episode and I totally forgot it was about UAPs for most of it, such an incredible story of survival."

Very entertaining if you're keeping up with current media.

But completely separately, recently I've been listening to ""The Friendship Onion"" which is just Billy Boyd and Dom Monaghan (who played Pippin and Merry in Lord of the Rings) talking about random stuff (and lord of the rings stuff) and interviewing random people. They had Elijah Wood on and talked with him for a while. They had Sean Aston on as well. And random other people.

351,"I'm late to the party, but: SO MANY. 

5-4 is one of my favorites right now, though it is, by its nature, infuriating: it's about how bad the Supreme Court sucks.  

Conspirituality and I Don't Speak German are also kind of day-ruiners, but they're focused on conspiracies and the people who believe them. 

The Fall of Civilizations is not quite hardcore history level, but its presentation is fairly outstanding. Part audio drama, part history lecture about societies that I knew very little about. The Khmer episode is particularly good, but there aren't any bad ones so far. 

I have a soft spot for comedy improv podcasts as well: Hello from the Magic Tavern, Mega, Mission to Zyxx, and Comedy Bang Bang all come to mind. The others are more story-focused (to an extent), where CBB is the classic ""let's play a new character every week, and see where this goes"" style of improv."

548,"60 Songs to Explain the 90s.

551,THE BLINDBOY PODCAST!
552,"In Your Own Backyard - it's the story of the disappearance of California Polytechnic San Luis Obispo student Kristin Smart in the 90's! Absolutely wild story about how a whole bunch of things that could have gone wrong did go wrong in the investigation of this potential killing. Even more importantly, the guy who made the podcast has shone light on the issue and definitely contributed to a court case being re-opened!"
553,"i love Therapy Gecko! it's a series of real people calling lyle, a man dressed in a gecko suit, and they discuss problems, stories from their life, gain advice, stuff like that. some can be serious, but there are so many hilarious ones. he's on spotify and i definitely recommend!"
554,The Goons podcast. If you like offensive type humor and funny stories this is a great podcast run by four youtubers
555,"Your Own Backyard, by Chris Lambert. It's a true crime story that is responsible for closing and vindicating a 20+ year long unsolved homicide in a college town. Tragic and enraging what happened, but we finally have some resolution."
556,"Astonishing Legends- really long deep dives into curious things

The Vanished- serious inquiries into missing persons cases, with interviews of primary sources.

This is Actually Happening- stories of people who made it through a What If event. (Serious topics like mental health, family issues, crimes etc). Ethical

LeVar Burton Reads- solid stories well told

Myths and Legends- folklore, fairytales, and mythology from around the world. Light, funny, excellent storytelling."
557,Fall of Civilisations podcast
558,Dynamic Banter
559,The magnus archives.
560,"The Adventure Zone. Balance is easily the best D&D story ever recorded. The McElroy brothers are fantastic in general, but Griffin's storytelling in Balance is unmatched, his background in journalism and theater really shines through and makes for an emotional rollercoaster of a story.

Darknet Diaries is another favorite of mine, Jack Rhysider is an outstanding cybersecurity journalist who manages to interview some insanely interesting people that have impacted the internet as we know it in huge ways.

The Clark Howard podcast is my personal favorite financial podcast, and I never miss an episode. He does a great job giving out information that the average person wants to hear about, and is a master of ELI5ing financial topics."
561,"Got several comments in and no one seems to have mentioned 'My brother, my brother, & Me'. Great one in my opinion."

A grizzly bear wildlife researcher and friends who discuss real life animal attacks, help you to understand the how and why, what to do if you're next, and throws in a bunch of jokes. I recommend it to everyone I meet these days I like it so much

Also, the Hamish and Andy podcast. Slightly niche given its the continuation of their drive time Australian radio show, but no aussies I introduce to the pod get into it as well. I have one laughing fit every episode."
568,Planet Money and it spin off The Indicator are great intros to economics.
569,"Just the zoo of us - Great podcast where they 'review' animals on effectiveness, ingenuity and esthetics. Super chill, good information (nice fun-facts) and good (somewhat nerdy but not too nerdy) humor. Love it, instantly became one of my favorite podcasts"
570,"Cocaine & Rhinestones, about the history of country music in the 20th century.

Can't believe I haven't seen it in the comments. The second season's gotta be the greatest podcast ever done."
571,"If you're at all into cars and motoring in a top gear sort of way, then Smith and Sniff are a must listen too.

Smith is an ex-Fifth Gear presenter, amongst other things (Jonny Smith), and ""Sniff"" is Richard Porter, a long-standing car article writer and involved in Top Gear and Grand Tour a fair bit it seems.

Both have aced the industry and have fantastic banter.

I've been working my way through their back catalogue and I have to say every episode has been excellent easy listening for sure. There's so much content I'm almost exclusively listening to them at the moment in fact, and that's fine!"
572,Mugglecast -If you're a Harry Potter fan.

578,No love for the Adam Friedland Show huh?
579,"I don't know about that, with Jim Jefferies 

Every episode is on a random topic, they get experts in to talk about it and they ask Jim (Australian comedian if you didn't know) a series of questions on the topic then the expert goes through and says whats right and wrong. I can not overstate how funny it is."
580,The Rich Roll Podcast
581,Cocaine and Rhinestones
582,"It's new, but Richard Wiseman has a skeptic's podcast called *On Your Mind* that I have been enjoying.

*Oh no, Ross and Carrie* is another skeptics podcast that is wonderful, where they try religions and alternative medicine, investigate hauntings and psychics.

For runners:

*Nobody Asked Us with Des and Kara*, hosted by two Olympics distance runners.

*Ali on the Run*, who interviews professional runners down to every day runners, and the interviews are always entertaining. 

And I adore Conan, but he's gotten enough love in this thread. "
583,"Three I never stop listening to:
Dungeons and Daddies. It's a group of friends playing a D and D campaign but they all happen to be great at ad lib, extremely funny and because they work in creative industries, and incredible story formed out of dice rolls. 

Infinite monkey cage. This one has a significant back catalogue and is technically a bbc radio 4 show. It's Brian Cox the physicist (and d:ream key board player) and Robin Ince the comedian talking to two or three scientists and a comedian about a specific topic in science. They are always very funny and interesting

And my favourite: Smith and Sniff. A podcast where two friends talk about cars and many other things. This one is like being down the pub with a couple of mates. Jonny Smith (who does the late brake show on YouTube and was on fifth gear) and Richard Porter (who was a producer on top gear at its peak) both know stupid amounts of stuff about cars but also have an ability to fly off on stupid tangents and generate catchphrases at will. In no other podcast will you go from the intricacies of a triumph 2000 to a mitsubishi airtowel discussion and still be crying laughing."
584,Making Sense podcast by Sam Harris. Deeply pondered-over discussions about everything whether it's philosophy or global affairs.
585,Forehead Fables is pretty funny. They've also got a DND Podcast going as well called Die of Laughter. Both pretty funny stuff
586,Dungeons and daddies and anything by sanspants radio.
587,"Lights Out: Pretty spooky, well researched and good to listen to on a car ride or a closing shift. 

The Official Podcast: As an avid viewer of Moist Crit1kal, this may be a bit biased, but very few forms of media have made me laugh as hard as this."
588,"Dungeons And Daddies: Not a BDSM podcast.

5 people play dnd with hilarious results. The audio quality is much better than any other live play dnd show. And the DM is a professional writer for several major video games (borderlands 2, God Of War)

It's hilarious and has a ton of heart."
589,"Friends Per Second - excellent podcast about video game news and the industry in general. Hosted by several games journalists and youtube personalities. Each episode is a few hours long and includes an interview with someone from the industry.

Ones and Tooze - Economics podcast by Foreign Policy and hosted by Adam Tooze, something of a superstar economic historian from Columbia University. Very informative and breaks down events in the world of Economics (the effects of Brexit, the lasting effects of the Iraq War, etc)

Celestial Citizen - A futurology podcast that examines what a future of space exploration/settlement would look like, with a strong focus on how expansion into space could be done in a way to lessen or address existing inequalities on Earth. Ethics and social justice of a space going human race."
590,"I've recently started listening to British Scandals and have been really enjoying it. They go into depths on subjects that everyone in the UK is vaguely familiar with (examples The Profumo Affair, the phone hacking scandal, Robert Maxwell, Lord Lucan etc) and their really quite fascinating. Done in a fun and engaging way- the Barings bank episodes were massively anxiety inducing though!

You're Dead to Me is a lovely lighthearted History podcast done by one of the Horrible History writers Greg Jenners. Covers a really wide range of time periods and subjects- I particularly enjoy the ones focussed on historical figures. For a more serious history podcast Fall of Civilisations is excellent."
591,"I like SadBoyz, they talk about feelings and other things also. I'd like to mention that on,e if not, both of the hosts have Adhd so they tend to jump around topics a lot. The hosts are also mixed race, so they sometimes talk about their experiences surrounding that as well."
592,"Searched every comment and couldn't see a single one mentioning Hello Internet.

I'm not recommending it as something ""worth listening to"" since it is just two guys talking about anything from plane crashes to iPhones but I'm surprised no one mentioned it."
593,Really surprised not to see anyone mentioning Shit Town on here. Fascinating and heartbreaking story. Really made me think about how every person I interact with has a million facts about them I don't know or may never know.

601,"I'm a fucking podcast/information addict so this list is neither comprehensive nor in any particular order, but here are some of my favorites:

The Huberman Lab- High quality neurobiology info with an emphasis on tools and protocols for optimizing daily life and health.

Armchair Expert- Interviews with all sorts of folks, from actors and pop stars, to philosophers and academics, innovators and titans of industry. I think what sets it apart is the balance it strikes between an analytical interview and genuine human connection, plus the fact check at the end. Dax can be a little divisive to some, but personally I think he's extremely lovable, earnest, and intelligent. Specifically their ""Experts on expert"" episodes are my favorite.

The Tolkien Professor- Pretty niche but so valuable if you're into Tolkien. Thorough chapter by chapter breakdowns and other analyses.

In Our Time: A BBC-4 podcast in which Melvin brag hosts panels of experts on topics ranging through history, philosophy, religion, etc. Dense, but might be my favorite. Just really reliable and enriching.

Take Your Shoes Off- Comedy/interview podcast with Rick Glassman. He's just a wonderfully quirky, unique character and I love him dearly.

WTF with Marc Maron- An OG interview pod. Marc is rough around the edges but his honesty, vulnerability, and efforts to evolve are admirable, and in any case, he's possibly the best interviewer in the game.

Philosophize This!- Well-executed philosophy podcast that has enough depth to satisfy those with a background in the field but accessible enough for those with casual interest.

I have to stop now or this list will bloat to like 30 pods."

609,"I really enjoy Planet Money from NPR. They take all kinds of economic topics and apply them in a way that's easily digestible for non-econ people. Usually involving actually doing the subject to provide a great point of reference, like buying junk bonds, producing a song, or reviving a comic book character."

623,"On Mobile so I can't check if it's been posted, but The Skeptic's Guide to the Universe is one of the finest science media sources out there. Excellent reporting and just enough banter and jokes to keep you listening, but honestly the science and skeptical thinking is enough most episodes."

All of these are from RoosterTeeth, who some people may know from such hits as Red vs Blue, RWBY, Fails of the Weak, Achievement Hunter, etc. My personal favorites are F**kface & ANMA, because Geoff Ramsay stars in both, but at this point I get pretty much a daily dose of RT even though I've long grown out of a lot of their content."

It's Jon (the funny, nerdy guy out of 8/10 cats) talking regularly with a couple of world's best guys who are charting the future of a low carbon, low emissions, sustainable world.

There's a free ~90min version on Spotify, or Patreon it and get the full 150-180mins. Done weekly.

  


They now regularly tour it in stadiums - it's pretty popular

  


They do 'best of' versions every 40 EPs or so, which is basically just them talking shit and laughing. Very good and addictive"
701,"I love that all of the top answers in this thread are things I either currently listen to or fell off of at some point. I listen to way too many podcasts. 

My recommendation:

[The Critshow](https://thecritshowpodcast.com/) is a *Powered by the Apocalypse* TTRPG podcast that is absolutely fantastic. Their primary game is *Monster of the Week* but they play different *PBtA* game in various settings as part of their portal hopping adventures each season. It's been going for about 5 years now. The community that's built up around it through their Discord is among the best out there as well. Literally saved my life.

They also have a couple of wonderful patreon exclusive actual play shows to go with the main show along with a bunch of one shots of various systems ranging from one page RPGs written by the cast to guest GMs running games like *Fate of Cthulhu* and *Earthdawn*. 

The first patreon show was a 68 episode run called *Hero Salad* where the main characters were heroes who went through a mysterious change and woke up as fruit and vegetable people. The puns are strong in that one.

The other, which is ongoing and currently on episode 133, is called *Perilous Tides*. It's a pirate show playing *Rapscallion*. If you enjoy pirate shenanigans that show has it in spades. Demons, whirlpools, ships, accents, a beefy lady with a tattoo of a mantis shrimp that makes her punch good. it's got it all!"

They have some fantastic guests as well - Justin McElroy in one of their early episodes, Janet Varney is in so many episodes they call her their 4th host, even Thomas Sanders was on recentlt. Created by Adal Rifai who's also in Hello from the Magic Tavern

Rude Tales of Magic - a d&d podcast that is incredibly chaotic, hilarious, and sometimes weirdly emotional? Branson Reese (creator of the comic/cartoon Swan Boy) is so fucking funny as a DM, he's great at thinking on the fly. 

Oh These Those Stars of Space - a sister podcast of Rude Tales of Magic, but it's based on a TTRPG called ""Lasers & Feelings"" and run by Joe Lepore. It's a Star Trek parody type of show with plenty of recurring characters and some new ones (all played by the cast of Rude Tales, plus their producer Taylor Moore). 

Also, if you like true crime but are sick of listening to stories about the same serial killers and weird disappearances, try Swindled - it focuses on white collar crime, scammers/con men, and some truly wild corporate scandals. It's just one guy, telling you a story with some fantastic research behind it. He's done episodes on Anna Delvey, Simon Leviev, J&J, Herbalife, and recently, an episode about the Balloon Boy that I haven't had a chance to yet but know will be fantastic."

I know many people listen to nothing but informational style podcasts, but it's a well written combo of absurdist comedy and weird horror (it leans far more in a comedy tone, the horror is more plot content).

I'm also a fan of WTF with Marc Maron. I don't listen to all of his content because there are plenty of celebrities I'm not interested in hearing about, but he's interviewed such a cross section of humanity that I imagine you'll be able to find at least one or two people who you'd want to check out."

733,Science vs
734,"Bear Grease podcast... ""Where we explore things that are forgotten, yet relevant. Where we look for insight in unlikely places... And we tell the stories of American who live they're life close to the land""

This is a pretty eclectic podcast, my favorite episode are the deep dives into history, on fascinating characters who have slipped through the cracks. Like Holt Collier, born a slave in the south in 1846, at 14 he fought in the Civil War FOR THE CONFEDERACY!  Later on became the most famous bear hunting guide in the south, and guided Teddy Roosevelt on the hunt where the term ""Teddy Bear"" was coined. Holt was the star of that story, as well. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. His actual real life was crazier than Forrest Gump's fictional life.

Or there is an episode on Lewis Wetzel... lived in the late 1700s his entire family was murdered by Native Americans as a teenager. He vowed for revenge and proceeded to be probably one of the most prolific serial killers ever. Partly because the town was cheering him on. He hunted Native Americans like they were prey. He was involved in countless gunfights and altercations, yet lived to be an old man. Absolutely fascinating story."

848,"My Advice: Always start a podcast at the beginning of a show. Always. 

1. **Radiolab** - amazing science based show in a story format. The episode usually has a theme that toes 3 different stories together. I've heard such incredible things on this show that I still talk about things I learned from episodes I heard 15 years ago. Very addictive and mind blowing stories. *(1 hour episodes of 3 stories)*

2.  **Criminal** - story format about odd true crimes and legal mysteries that usually has some crazy twists. You'll find yourself saying ""I'm Phoebe Judge"". *(15-20 min episodes the first season or two than then go to 30+ mins)*

3. **99% Invisible** - this is an incredible show about the overlooked or hidden things in the world of design, for example the amount of research that went into developing the sound a Walkman makes when it closes, or when a car door closes because they could be silent, or discriminatory architecture. Plus Roman Mars's voice is addictive *(episodes start between 6 and 11 minutes the first season, bump up to 20 mins, then eventually grow to 45-60mins)*

4. **This American Life** - all real, thought provoking stories from a range of people. Stories that often have many twists and turns, stories that make you say ""You couldn't write kind of stuff"".    
The stories vary from being about average people, notable people, occasionally celebrities with crazy life stories (Mike Birbiglua's Sleep Walk With Me story originated here before becoming a book than a movie). The stories are very engaging and touch on many topical subjects sometimes very emotional or shocking. *(show is 1 hour long but often separated into 3 separate stories of similar subject of matter or similar emotion, but they are intertwined, not one story after the other)*

Edit: 5. **Freakonomics** - You may or may not be familiar with the book by Stephen J. Dubner and Steven Levitt, but they are two economists who look at the data of the world very differently and will make you think about the way the world works and what impacts it. The book was so good it became a documentary, which then became a podcast. Some of the topics they've covered include how children's names move down the economic ladder as they decrease in popularity, how abortion being illegal or legal is strongly linked to the rise or fall in crime rates, respectively, 20 years later. *(Shows are an hour long and often touch many subjects)*

These all added so much to my education and growth as a person. I can't tell you how many books I've read, or new experiences I've had because of these."

875,"This is kind of like asking ""What book is actually worth reading?"" -- There are several podcasts that millions will find amazing, and you will not. It's very subjective. Find something on a topic you're interested in and listen..."
876,"Darknet Diaries with Jack Rhysider. The older episodes especially are awesome. He talks a lot about network security but in an easy to understand way for people who aren't into that stuff. Also he obviously talks about the darknet like drug sales and stuff. 

My favorite episodes are the ones about penetration engineers who physically break into companies to test their security.    

Honestly every episode is fantastic"

Kingslingers. It's a book club podcast where one host is a huge Stephen King fan and one is brand new. You can read along with them and then listen to the podcast where they discuss the chapters you just read. 

They go through the Dark Tower series in season one, related King books in season 2, and are currently doing King's greatest hits for season 3.

891,"Fall of Civilizations by Paul Cooper. If you like history but don't want like multi-part epic podcasts you have to hold the thread of, this is a great one. At times there are two parts, but rarely, and the episodes are usually 1.5-2.5 hours long.

They are extremely well-researched and Paul Cooper's voice is very pleasant and great to fall asleep to if that's what you use podcasts for. There's a good mix of Western and non-Western civilizations covered. The thing I like most is that there is a companion YouTube channel where the podcasts are put to videos that look very slick and professional, very pleasant to watch if you want a visual component.

https://www.youtube.com/c/FallofCivilizationsPodcast"
892,"The Fall of Civilizations by Paul Cooper.

Every episode starts off with a tale of someone discovering or just visiting the ruins of a civilization, amazed at what they find.

Mr. Cooper describes the podcast as wanting to look at the entire history of a civilization, from the very formation of the earth to the collapse of a society, to better understand why it collapsed.

The last episode I listened to was on the Aztec empire, which was interesting in that aside from using European sources, it uses sources from the Aztecs themselves, which gives fresh insights such as the fact the Aztecs never saw the Spanish as some kind of holy spirits, as is often told.

They even have someone who natively speaks Nahuatl, the language of the Aztec empire, recite some of the Aztec sources, to allow the listener to understand what the language sounds like and be immersed in the podcast."
893,The Huberman Lab podcast. It is an excellent podcast covering a broad set of topics around health.
894,The British History Podcast. Best History podcast out there.
895,"Hear me out, The Midnight Gospel. 

It offers a wacky animated visual trip as a bonus for the deeply touching dialogue between the main character, based on and voiced by an actual podcaster, and whoever is the special guest.

You have to watch this 8 episode series TWICE at once: one time focusing on just listening the talks the main character has with the surroundings, and the other time focusing on the visuals."
896,All Fantasy Everything - they fantasy draft everything and anything. But the banter between the three hosts are what makes it for me. Plus they get great guests that add to the fun.

908,"Here are the main few that I love to listen to in my podcast app.  
  
* **99% Invisible with Roman Mars:** Such a soothing voice on all things design, architecture and random factoid.
* **Beyond the Screenplay:** This is the extension from his Youtube Channel Lessons from the Screenplay and they talk about films they love.  
* **Pitchfork Economics:** This one will get you all pissed about capitalism and its many failings in modern life.  
* **Hardcore History:** Ill be honest I like his single shorter episodes than is multi-episode (20hr+) series. Painfotainment and Prophets of Doom were amazing episodes.  
* **History of the 90's:** Fun history pieces of the decade I grew up in, some I didnt even really know about.  
* **The Rewatchables:** movie recaps with The Ringer cast with categories and hot takes.  
* **S1E1:** A group of friends pretend to studio exec's and watch pilots of sitcoms to either greenlight or cancel just based of the pilot and nothing else.  
* **Unfcking the Republic:** Max and 99 break down many of the many institutions of the last few decades.  
* **Strong Towns:** Chuck Marone is advocating for better city design and public transportation.  
* **Canadaland:** Canadian News journalist  
* **Canadian History EhX:** everything you want to know about canadian history, big or small.  
* **Spark from CBC** digital and future advancements in technology.
  
Some notable and limited series:  
  
* **Blindspot: The Road to 9/11** The is a 8-episode series about the 1993 WTC bombing and how it was a trial run for the 9/11 attacks.  
* **Hunting Warhead by CBC** This one follows the journalists and police on a global mission to expose the darkest corners of the internet.  
* **Missing on 9/11** A woman disappears on the evening of September 10th, 2001. She is not killed in the attacks and she is still listed as a missing persons. Where did she go? As of yet, this is still unresolved and no new episodes since 2021.  
* **Some Place Under Neith:** The episode series called Parasocial Exploitation (episode 56 to 66) about the dangers of social media and rampant exploitation of children of family vloggers.  
* **You Must Remember this** Six degrees of Song of the South series.  
* **It could Happen Here:** The very start of this podcast did a 6-7 episode series of what would happen in there was a second civil war happening today. Fascinating listen!  
* **The Big One: Your survival guide** This was an awesome listen about the BIG ONE that is suppose to hit the west coast any day now!"
909,"I have a bias towards informative podcasts. I am presently listening to [Not past it](https://spotify.link/aUqXt1AnWyb) a ""this week in history "" type podcast, [The weirdest thing I learned this week](https://spotify.link/twCmWrFnWyb), and going through the backlog to get caught up on [Gastropod](https://spotify.link/fQlPLOLnWyb) which ""looks at food through the lens of science and history "" 

Stuff I have listened to include

[Ask us anything ](https://spotify.link/I0neb4QnWyb) is one that I enjoy, as of writing they are in between seasons.

 [Can we be friends?](https://spotify.link/Npc5FcVnWyb) was a cute, but no new episodes have come out since 2021.

 [Flash forward ](https://spotify.link/dvZpXY2nWyb), now having ended, was enjoyable. Fun predictions about the future, like ""what if space pirates stole the moon? 

[Ologies](https://spotify.link/wGNnS5eoWyb) interviews with various ""-ologists""

[Reply all](https://spotify.link/YKwOlMqoWyb) had some good humor and stories

It's hosted by Devon, who I mainly know from that show, Abigail Thorne, actress from Philosophy Tube, and Alice Caldwell-Kelly/Avizandum from Trash Future and Well There's Your Problem. It's really well edited and all the hosts have pretty good chemistry.
Only note I have is that in the first few episodes, Alice didn't know what bass was when she was putting in clips of the movies so you'll just hear the most inaudible shit followed by them losing all their minds."

983,"Before I go on yoinking a bunch of these for my own following lists, here's a few of the ones I absolutely love.

1.) Ologies with Alie Ward is a fucking amazing science podcast, where the host interviews an expert in every field she has episodes on. There have been episodes on everything from volcanos to death to trees, always an in depth interview each time. She also makes a point to ask listener questions as an entire section of the podcast, which she asks from Patreon, which is A DOLLAR. I fucking love it and it's my favorite.

2.) Fall of Civilizations has only had 17 episodes in about 4 years. Each episode is multiple hours long, and details the entire rise and fall of a different empire each time. It's incredibly well put together and so interesting each episode.

3.) Lore and Noble Blood. If you listen to podcasts, you've probably heard of at least one.  Both are by the same company. Lore is about mystical and historical events and talks about everything from H. H. Holmes to creatures of folklore. Noble Blood goes into the history of a different person of nobility and how fucked up their life was, and also how they may have fucked up other people's lives too.

4.) Honorable mentions of uber specific.

Voice Acting Mastery and The Voiceover Gurus podcasts are two of the best voice acting podcasts.

Voyage to the Stars is a really funny improv audio comedy that ties itself to a story outline and episode outline but leaves it up to the actors beyond that.

Adeptus Ridiculous is a very funny Warhammer podcast, and if you know NOTHING about Warhammer but have heard of it, give a few episodes a listen. Even if you never get into it, it's really funny and it's worth your time."

Such as the rocks episode or trees episode, where it's just a couple of friendly chill rock and tree enthusiasts. It's also fairly accessible for all audiences and doesn't go too deep or specific in any one field such that it can't be understood if you know nothing about it to begin.

My favourite episodes have been Killdozer, the great molasses flood and plot of cats.  

The Villian was right - 2 Canadian comedians watch movies and ask what if the Villain was Right? What if they weren't all bad and perhaps the good guys aren't so good. Maybe they had thier reasons ya know? It's a good light hearted listen especially when they really get into it or have to grasp at straws.

Then there's Oologies, which will break the minds of the misophonic because Allie Ward won't drink a glass of water and silence her constant glottal clicks. Has the potential to be a great show, but shoots itself in the foot by derailing the conversation to be about mundanities and not the topic.

Monsters and Mysteries was never about monsters or mysteries, instead it was about the production of other, more successful shows about monsters and mysteries.

A lot of people dislike them for that but whenever that happens the other cast members, especially the women, step in and educate him on things.

British Scandal is just fun, sort of like a novel on various British stories. Low stakes but fun.

Bloodlines by ESPN investigates tells the story of horse racing. Very cool information to know.

No Compromise by NPR tells the story of a political movement involving 2nd amendment absolutists, how they grew, who they target, and how it's grown. Pretty interesting.

Dax and Monica are both incredibly intelligent--Dax's vast knowledge and understanding about a wide variety of topics mixes with Monica's fresh approach of topics with incredibly heightened emotional intelligence. Also, if you want a really good laugh they do Armchair Anonymous where there is a prompt and people write in stories that they will then choose from and those individuals tell the story on the podcast.

People that don't understand it because they only look at snippets of the show taken out of context love to call him an extreme right winger but the guy is truly heavily lefy leaning with a few right wing positions, which rounds his views out very well.  He interviews all kinds of people from all walks of life who are highly intelligent and they have extremely insightful conversations about everything imaginable under the sun, so it's great for learning new things and getting introduced to guests that you will enjoy and want to follow further.

2. Snap Judgment - So much variety here. Stories range from hippo attacks on the Zambezi to a beautiful Peabody award-winning story about suicide called Finn and the Bell. Also every story is told to a beat. 

3. Spooked - If you like Snap Judgment, Spooked is presented by the same people, and in a very similar fashion. The difference is that all Spooked stories are exactly what you'd expect them to be based on the title. All stories centre around the paranormal and unexplained, a guilty pleasure of mine.

For example, Coco Chanel, the lady who founded *that* fashion company? Yeah, she really, really liked being involved with The Third Reich.

Or about how the Cult leader of Colonia Dignidad, Paul Schafer and a close figure to the Chilean dictator Pinochet, was a pedophile so obsessed with children that he dressed up one of Pinochet's execution victims as Santa Claus, gathered up all the children in his compound to watch Santa float down the river and then shot him in front of the kids before saying ""Christmas is over, now the only holiday we have to celebrate is my birthday"" all because he was jealous of the fact that the kids got excited about Christmas.

The hosts chat a lot, go off topic and aren't always ""professional"", but I think it adds to the conversational tone.

3) One Year - each season they pick a year and do episodes about impactful moments that happened during that year, normally from angles that we don't usually hear. They interview people who actually experienced these historic events and let them tell their stories.

Also, Cabinet of Curiosities and Lore are good depending on the stories covered. I would say, older episodes of Lore are usually always good. But, Cabinet of Curiosities has been more consistent since it started (plus it is shorter so it's a good starting point for podcasts).

Edit: also Get Sleepy for when you need something to sleep to.

2047,"Buried Bones. True crime journalist and author Kate Winkler Dawson and retired investigator Paul holes discuss old true crime cases through a 21st century lens.

2054,"The Magnus Archives! It's a 5 season long eldritch horror story (hear me out if you don't like horror), hearing after-the-fact accounts of the paranormal and eventually confronting it directly. It starts as a pure anthology, but slowly turns episodic as we get to know the main protagonists and recurring antagonists more and more. I cant recommend it enough! 

I normally can't stand horror stories, but TMA is different. The writer, Johnathan Sims, makes a strong effort to maintain the distinction between horror and trauma, with 1 notable exception that he apologizes for before the episode. Characters will certainly suffer and even die, but their experiences are strictly paranormal, limiting how much the audience feels the horror themselves while still telling one of the most compelling stories I've ever heard.

It's also very gay, which is a big plus in my book."

2120,"13 Minutes to the Moon. It's a BBC produced product with an excellent host (amazing voice).

The idea for the pod came from wanting to tell the story of the first ever lunar landing from a new prospective. 

The podcast is a 10 part series that breaks down the history, and the people who made it possible with tons of interviews of all the people involved including the astronauts. 

It took the lunar module 13 minutes from leaving lunar orbit to make landing, and we have the audio recordings of the communications between Houston and the astronauts. The pod sets out to have you listen to that 13 minutes by episode 10, uninterrupted, and having a clear and exact understanding off what's happening, and it's absolutely riveting. It wasn't smooth, they had problems, and the real-time trouble shooting is mind blowing. The accomplishment is put into perspective and it's simply incredible what they did. 

A MUST listen if you're at all interested in that sort of thing. It's fantastic."
2121,"Sounds Like a Cult.

They profile different cult-like things each week, from SoulCycle to Corporate Culture to Mommy Blogs, digging deep into the problems (and sometimes benefits) of each. They end with a judgment of how safe it actually is to partake in. Their takes are hilarious and sadly accurate.

Because of them, I now know to never try to work for a big bank or indulge in fancy wines. Well, okay, I already wasn't doing that, but that's beside the point. The point is, it's funny, informative, and they make some great points!"

2189,"Chris DeMakes A Podcast

It's a music breakdown podcast. Chris (singer/guitar player for Less Than Jake) brings on a guest and tells them to pick any song in their discography to breakdown. Some choose their hits and some choose their personal favorite songs. The fact that the artist chooses and Chris doesn't pick really shows. The musicians are a lot more enthusiastic because they aren't necessarily breaking down the same song they've done interviews about for ~20 years, it's their decision. 

Anyway Chris breaks these songs down to a science. It legitimately shocks a lot of the guests how in depth Chris gets. He even surprises some guests with parts of a song that the artist didn't even pick up on. Even though they wrote it. Besides the mechanics of the song itself they break down lyrical meaning, who produced it, where it was produced, etc. You get a lot of ""insider"" type information and not just a surface level breakdown. 

The music varies. I know people hear that it's the singer of LTJ and assume it's a ska/punk skewing podcast. It isn't. He has done episodes with songs from almost every mainstream genre possible. Just go check out the last ~20 episodes on their page. 

Also he doesn't always bring on the vocalist of a band. So you don't just hear from the faces of bands.

I can't recommend the podcast enough. I've listened to every episode. Even though a lot of the songs aren't my taste it's still fascinating to hear Chris and the artist dive into it."

Believing the Bizarre: cover a paranormal, alien, conspiracy theory, etc. and then they judge one their scale on if they believe it or not based on the history/legend and encounters. I think Tyler and Charlie's banter is funny and it really makes you think about the topic. 

Morbid: love me some true crime, but also like it when they cover spooky stuff too.

2210,"ShxtsnGigs Podcast. It's a men's podcast that's actually funny, not toxic and all around good vibes and positive energy lol"
2211,"- History Chicks - each episode discusses the life of a woman from history (broad range of time periods, cultures and subjects covered but there is a bias for American women since the podcasters are American).  I like that they give a 30 second summary at the start of each episode and give you context around what else is happening during the subject's life. 

- This Podcast Will Kill You - each episode focuses on a disease or medical condition (mostly viruses) and explains the epidemiology, history and how scared we should be.  The history section is particularly interesting because you see how diseases have shaped global history, won or lost wars, led to certain discoveries, etc, and how history has impacted on the way we have viewed and treated different diseases.  The podcasters are epidemiologists but present the information at a level that definitely doesn't require a science degree. 

- ADHD As Females - two women with late diagnoses of ADHD talk about how ADHD has impacted their lives and interview people with ADHD and experts on ADHD.  It's a pretty new podcast and not professionally produced but really good content for women with ADHD. 

- Media Storm - journalism podcast that looks at current issues like homelessness, refugees or sex work and focus on the views of people with lived experience.  It's been nominated for lots of awards despite being a fairly new podcast and it presents things in a really different way to mainstream news outlets. 

- The Guilty Feminist - comedy podcast that also considers serious issues.  Each episode is hosted by Deborah Frances White and a comedian co-host and is recorded in front of a live audience.  Guests are sometimes comedians, sometimes people involved in other arts forms (musicians, actors, poets) and sometimes people involved in activism or who have done something that's worth talking about (e.g. the most recent episode had the creator of the worlds first vagina museum).  

- John Bercow's Absolute Power - former speaker of the British House of Commons explains how politics works in Great Britain and who actually holds the power.  I'm a lawyer in a common law jurisdiction and I learnt a lot."
2212,"Copy pasted from last time this was asked:

**What Are You Doing, Movie?** from Friends in Your Head.

Full length movie commentaries by a panel of guys who work in technical fields in the industry - vfx artists, editor, puppeteer, etc. They have fascinating insights into how movies are made.

Sometimes it's just making fun of bad movies, but as the series goes on they develop a real skill for analyzing narrative structure and story in a way that has completely transformed the way I think about not just film but any story.

I cannot recommend enough. There's hundreds of hours of free content. Too bad they don't make new episodes anymore."
2213,Casefile or DNA ID. They're both just straight up facts without banter (like listening to a dateline episode.) DNA ID is my new favorite because it spotlights these long cold cases that have been solved with genetic genealogy! Super cool. Also very respectful to the victims.

His conversation with Chris Voss, a former FBI negotiator is pretty good.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EguLJgkc54) Granted Elon Musk can be a polarizing figure for some but his conversations with Lex on AI, self-driving cars, and various stuff have also helped me learn a lot while getting sleepy at the same time. It was good asmr.

[For Neuroscience, there's Andrew Huberman. But I also really enjoyed his conversation with Lex here.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I5I56uVvLw)

2232,"'Inside Of You' with Michael Rosenbaum- has a lot of interviews with people that played parts in sci-fi/superhero shows & movies, star wars, star trek, etc. Probably my favorite podcast for a while now. He films it for YouTube but also has just the audio versions on the regular platforms. The Sam Witwer episode was probably my most recent favorite."

Helped solve a long-standing cold case in San Luis Obispo. Chris Lambert was from the area, he had seen missing and seeking information billboards about Kristin Smart. The curiosity got to him and he just started asking people who were from the area if they knew anything. To his surprise people talked. It's really hard not to feel like you knew Kristin from the podcast since a lot of her friends, some family, college acquaintances, pretty much anyone who knew her came on and talked about her. This podcast was a huge part in finding people who could help the SLO sheriff's department piece together what happened to Kristin. 25 years later, they did. The last episode has not been uploaded as of me posting this. I was so gripped by this story, Kristin was very loved and you feel the heartache thst her friends and family have gone through these last two decades. I hope that they get the chance to heal after so long."

Or as Michael says it: ""A podcast where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have spread like rabies through the American nervous system""

The longer description:

""5-4 is a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks. It's a progressive and occasionally profane take on the ideological battles at the heart of the Court's most important landmark cases, and an irreverent tour of all the ways in which the law is shaped by politics.

Listen each week as hosts Peter, Michael, and Rhiannon dismantle the Justices' legal reasoning on hot-button issues like affirmative action, gun rights, and campaign finance, and use dark humor to reveal the high court's biases."""

2583,"If you like **Horror** or **Psychology** (or better yet, both) then you might like what we're doing.

On [Horror Makes Us Happy](https://horrormakesushappy.com/) we pseudo-psychologically profile creators in the horror biz to uncover the real reasons people love horror.  Our short-term goal is that fans might get to hear things in our interviews that they may never hear anywhere else. Medium-term we think listeners might benefit from hearing us talk about some of the difficult topics that come up in a healthy and respectful manner. Long-term, if we talk to enough people we might start uncovering some common threads that might teach us something interesting about the horror community as a whole.

Here are a few nice things some guests have said at the ends of our interviews with them:

* ""I'm not blowing smoke up your ass, but this is one of my favorite interviews that I've done, and I've done a ton."" - Steve Barton (Dread Central, Terrifier 2)    
* ""You guys have asked a lot of questions I've never been asked before - which is saying something, because I've been answering questions for 25 years on this particular topic. So kudos to you guys, you've given me a lot to think about, actually."" - Rodrigo Gudino (Rue Morgue)    
* ""When you brought up those three words at the end, I pointed at the screen and was like, 'This guy's fucking good!' "" - Josh Malerman (Birdbox, Daphne)    
* ""I know we're out of time - I can't believe we've talked for two hours."" - Bill Oberst Jr. (Dis, Circus of the Dead)    
* ""I don't feel like I'm being psychoanalyzed, but I do feel like I'm being probed - by people who are not only interested in the answers, but who care about the answers, and know these answers have applications to others ... and that maybe this might even be useful, as well as ornamental."" - John Skipp (Fright Night, The Light at the End)

Our website's not fully optimized for mobile yet, but there's a player there, and we're on all the major podcasting platforms.  You can see who we've interviewed by scrolling through the playlist."

Always amusing how far back he goes (one starts with the dinosaurs!) and he doesn't try to cover everything that happens in a society, just the key parts so you get a good grounding in general history too.

It's a podcast about engineering disasters.

With slides. 

It's an engineer, the engineers former roommate and best friend,  and a law school dropout discussing the disasters in a serious, but sometimes humorous tone.  They know when to be serious, and when they can let loose. 

They talk about disasters, why they happened, what happened, and what we learned (nothing). They go deep into the details. 

They have 2 types of disasters they discuss. 
I call them ""Actual Failures"" and ""Topic Disasters""

Actual Failures are an event, say the Titanic or 9/11.

Topic Disasters are more of systemic failures like  Bad Bike Infrastructure or Armored Trains

Be prepared for long episodes. 90 minutes is considered short, and their longest episode is (albeit a Patreon exclusive) Beer, clocking in at around 3 and a half hours

As the 2nd paragraph suggested, there are slides, and their episodes are on YouTube. It's a video podcast, but not something that you need to keep an eye on. You can go audio only, but you're missing part of it if you don't consume the slides.

I like to have it open on a 2nd monitor so I can glance over at it every so often when they make a reference to the image on screen."

Deep Convos (sometimes too deep) lol - Lex Fridman

2622,"American Scandal - narrative based podcasts on, well, scandals. Iran Contra, DuPont, Bernie Madoff, Big Tobacco, etc.

Spitballers - comedy podcast with different segments -- ""That's a Great Question"", ""Highway to Spell"", ""Liar Liar"" + more, and their signature seg is a draft (fantasy football style) of all sorts of things, food stuff, pop culture, movies, TV shows, etc.

Blowback - The 2003 Invasion and Occupation of Iraq was worse than you think. Worse than you can imagine. Excellently researched, a fresh perspective, detailed and infuriating. Season 2 was on all things Cuba, and how we fucked them hard

The Explorers - history of different explorers and expeditions. James Cook, Ferdinand Magellan, Christopher Columbus (barf), etc., Plus lesser known explorers like Abel Tasman, Fridtjof Nansen, and others

Flawed Theology - as an ex-Christian, I've been looking for a pod that would really go into theology itself and pick it apart. This is a super small-time podcast, but damn, it's really well thought out, well-researched, cathartic, and as someone who was fundamentalist and super into doctrine, it really scratches the itch I have to dig in and find everything wrong with what I used to believe (and there is a lot lol).

Honorable mention: not a podcast but an audio drama

Post-apocalyptic zombie thriller, and actually fucking done *right*. If you haven't listened, you're missing *out*."

That being said...

Old Standbys:
* 99% Invisible - I've learned so much from this podcast and Roman Mars' voice is like butter

* Hardcore History - an insanely detailed history mini novella that will make you feel like you just took a graduate course

* Welcome to Nightvale - funny, endearing Lovecraftian horror

Newer:
* Magnus Archives - a series of creepy pastas that became an entire cinematic universe

* Old Gods of Appalachia - really hard to explain if you're not from the cut, but I love the storytelling and world building. Old country folk tales + eldritch horror

* Radio Rental - hosted by Rainn Wilson! True spooky stories told by the people who lived them

* If Books Could Kill - debunks pop culturally relevant books like The Secret

* Normal Gossip - I've never been more excited for a show to come back. It's a nice little shot of dopamine and has some interesting meta commentary on gossip. Also appreciated the thinly veiled episode about Last Podcast on the Left 

*The Thrilling Adventure Hour - Honestly sad it ended. Podcast in the style of an old timey radio drama with recurring bits and a heavy hitting cast of actors. I also live near Sparks, NV and can't help singing the song to Sparks Nevada, Marshall on Mars whenever I pass by."

They're currently doing a miniseries going through Danny Boyle's career (which I haven't listened to cos I'm still somewhere in the 2021 episodes catching up!).

Hosted by a retired USN F/A-18 pilot and just episode after episode of riveting stories. For example, I was expecting the episode on the U-2 to be kind of boring, but it ended up being one of the most fascinating episodes of the entire podcast so far.

Also in the military aviation vein, [10 Percent True - Tales From the Cockpit](https://youtube.com/@10percenttrue) is fantastic as well. Lots of in depth stuff. Same with [Aircrew Interview](https://youtube.com/@Aircrewinterview), though he also interviews some civilian pilots who have flown things like the Concorde, for example.

Boris' poem he wrote after the Australian GP last year was the absolute pinnacle of verbal savagery. Absolutely brutal. I had to rewind several times because I was laughing so hard I was crying and missing lines. Note: having watched the races beforehand make MotoPG much more enjoyable.

If you're a serious motocross and supercross nerd and want to know just about everything there is to know about what's happening in those sports, you can't beat [PulpMX](https://youtube.com/@PulpMX). Hosted by a former factory mechanic turned veteran moto journalist, and chock full of pro rider and industry insider guests and co-hosts, and some of the best personalities in the sport (any episode with David Vuillemin, Jake Weimer, Ryan Villopoto, or Phil Nicoletti is guaranteed gold), Pulp always delivers. You will laugh. You will rage. You will do everything in between.

The PulpMX empire also includes a few excellent spin-off shows, most notably [The Re-Raceables](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL2ZlZWRzLmZlZWRidXJuZXIuY29tL1RoZVJlLXJhY2VhYmxlcw?ep=14), co-hosted by veteran motocross play-by-play commentator, Jason Weigandt, where big name guests are brought in to discuss epic races of yesteryear."

They both are greatly knowledgeable about the gaming industry, with Woolie having done QA work in the past. Both of them have varied tastes in terms of entertainment, have insanely great chemistry as co-hosts, and are fairly interesting to listen to in my own opinion.

Their podcast doesn't only feature gaming discussions, but it does make up the bulk of it. In terms of podcast length and frequency. It's 3-5 hour video podcasts that host live on Twitch almost every Monday on the channel ""Castle SuperBeast"", and an audio format is uploaded every Tuesday to other platforms. Video clips from the live podcast are uploaded throughout the week on Woolie's personal YouTube channel ""WoolieVS"" if you're not interested in the full podcast.

Three Bean Salad: Three comedians riffing for an hour. Every episode a gem. They try and pick a subject every week and it often deviates into whimsical obscurity. Try one of their best ofs for a feel. 

Where there a Will, There's a Wake: Kathy Burke talks to celebrities about their dream funeral. It's normally celebrities she's fond of so you may not have heard of them, but they're all great. You'll rarely find a better produced podcast. Sounds dour, but usually very uplifting and informative. 

Cuddle Club: Lou Saunders talks about cuddling (honestly, it's hilarious). Especially when she tries to sing the lyrics of a song by using only the word 'cuddle'. 

Honourable mentions to Athletico Mince, Off Menu and No Such Thing as a Fish. But they're probably already well represented."

2841,"1. 'Cautionary Tales'. Tim Harford is a master storyteller. He dissects disaster events and moments when people either really should have known better, or had no way to know, and then sees what can be learned from them. Some episodes are darker than others, but his way of constructing the story is always on point. My new favourite podcast.
2. 'Gossipmongers'. Although it's seemingly on permanent hiatus now, the existing back catalogue will keep you thoroughly entertained for a while. Two comedians collect salacious, deeply wrong, or simply hilarious tales from people's home towns. Most of it heavily embellished and often disgusting and definitely not politically correct. In a very British way. I haven't belly laughed like that in quite a while."

A consistently funny and insightful variety show, which gives advice to listeners, interviews a broad range of guests (from bee experts to trauma counsellors) and then makes them play a gameshow, and discusses topics. The hosts started on Buzzfeed many years ago, and had a popular YouTube channel. What I mostly like is how self-aware they are, and how the actively address and own their mistakes, which are bound to happen when addressing sensitive subjects. 

Frequent subjects of discussion include: mental health, gender identity, sexuality, friendship, relationships, dogs..."

Additionally, one of two hosts - Justin - is a GREAT analyst of the market, easily the most accurate market-caller I've ever listened to. You can both invest based on his advice and trade. 

Excellent podcast - just be sure to learn from them but don't just copy them. They do equity calls on the show but don't do the deep research into companies they're not interested in - so you can find your own gems based on their methods."

They have a ""nostalgia rating"" where they give a rating based on how they thought of the movie at the time, go over online reviews, some behind the scene info, a scene by scene breakdown and finish with a modern rating as adults.

No politics, no insurrerable drama, no drawn out stories that could have been summerized in 10 minutes but are drawn out to multiple 60 minute episodes.

If you were a kid in the 80's/90's you'll most likely have seen, at minimum, 80% of the movies they discuss."

Easily the most underrated podcast out there imo. The topics can be pretty heavy but there's some pretty mind-blowing philosophy there that does a good job of catering to both advanced learners as well as beginners while generally focusing on the practical ways that philosophy can be applied to every day life.

I'm a little biased because it literally changed my life and my son's since some of the principles ascertained there made me into a significantly better parent than I would otherwise be, and I now have an amazingly healthy and constructive relationship with my son as a result.

The Rewatchables - Movie lover discussions. Hosts Bill Simmon, Chris Ryan, and a small group of rotating guests. They hit all those action and comedy movies you've watched tons, including the staples of cinema. Breaking down the best performances, scenes, etc. Love them because most of the movies the discuss, I can remember scene for scene and if I can't, it reminds me to give them a rewatch. Suggested test episode: Unstoppable with guest Quentin Tarantino. 

How Did This Get Made - Movie hater discussions. Hosts Paul Scheer, June Diane Raphael (his wife), and the infamous Jason Mantzoukas! The polar opposite of of The Rewatchables, they force themselves to watch and then talk about the worst movies out there, albeit skipping most of the bottom of the bin, B-movie shlock. Quite a few times they will end up loving them in a so good it's bad fashion. Jason will just never not make me laugh and there live show recordings are always good.

* **Smartless** - Generally amusing, some great guests - very informal interview style

* **Swindled** - Excellent investigations and telling of how swindles unfold.

* **You're dead to me** - if you're a history fan, this is learning with someone who knows things, the host, and a comedian - there is a quiz at the end of you want to test yourself!
* **Curious cases of Rutherford and Fry** - more science, with Rutherford occasionally putting his body on the line for science

Couple topic examples. 1) Anna con artist that blew up recently and got a show., He did a great episode on her a few years ago. 2) One ofy favorite examples of the show is nestle with their formula. They will go into 3rd world countries and give money to hospitals to build a new birthing suite, with the stipulation that they get to have employees there. These employees would dress up as nurses and present. New mothers with nestle formula and say how it will make the baby stronger and smarter than of they breast feed. If a new mother doesn't breastfeed and her body didn't sense the colostrum being removed, production will dry up 7-10 days after birth and won't return. So these ignorant mothers would feed there baby formula, then be incapable of production, and not be able to afford formula so they would cut it, or go without. Basically an episode of nestle presiding offer thousand of infant deaths."

3372,"TimeSuck by Dan Cummins. It's largely true crime and major historical events, but arranged in a unique way and with frequent comedic bits throughout. For those who have a hard time listening to True Crime podcasts because of the super serious tone, this is the one for you. Dan seems to know exactly when to break up the heaviness with a crazy ass comedic tangent. It somehow never feels like inappropriate or disrespectful timing, he's very sensitive to tragedy but carefully plans his comedic sections so they feel just right. 

What Say You? Features Q and Sal from Impractical Jokers, and though it has been dormant for a few years now, the catalog of episodes is fun to listen to. Q and Sal have been friends for a long time and know how to make each other laugh and the stories they tell are usually hilarious. 

Fuck Face by Rooster Teeth is consistently hilarious even if you aren't into Rooster Teeth's stuff. Honestly, it's one of the last pieces of Rooster Teeth content i consume anymore and never fails to make me laugh. It's the ""podcast about nothing"" that consistently winds up striking comedic gold by sheer accident. 

Black Box Down is true crime about plane crashes, essentially. Interesting and detailed breakdowns of notable plane incidents throughout history, with appropriate levity and light heartedness thrown in so it's not too heavy. Also by Rooster Teeth.

Heroes and Halfwits- another by Rooster Teeth, they haven't made an episode of this show in years, but it's a Dungeons and Dragons podcast that is more about the improv comedy than it is the game itself. I'm not even interested in D&D but I re-listen to this show every so often because of how funny the story and characters are, and the way the players play off of each other leads to some hilarious moments.

Zack to the Future is a funny and interesting rewatch of Saved By the Bell featuring the actor who played Zack, a writer on the reboot, and guest appearances by other actors. You don't have to like the show; they mock it pretty hard, this is more of a ""wtf were we doing"" type of thing than a reverent thing. I don't like the show AT ALL but saw my share of it as a kid, so it's fun to see it reframed like this."

**If Books Could Kill** \- ""the airport bestsellers that captured our hearts and ruined our minds"" - they discuss and rip apart books like ""The Secret"" and ""Rich Dad Poor Dad."" Very funny and biting too. I'm starting to notice a pattern. One of the same hosts from Five Four.

**A History of Rock Music in 500 Songs** \- this podcast is great, and THOROUGH, and has a very dry British humor about it on occasion, and is very thoughtful when dealing with the absolute monsters that are frequently involved in the story. This podcast is going to run for like a decade.

**Mission to Zyxx** \- this show is over now but is SO GOOD. It's an improvised comedy Sci-fi show with great guests and great sound design. I never thought a sentient all knowing bean would make me laugh so hard.

**Finding Drago/Finding Desperado** \- these stories are also over but oh my god what a journey. Just as a teaser, Finding Drago (both are on the same feed) is about finding the internationally famous author behind a Rocky 4 fan fiction book. Try not to look anything up about how these turned out ahead of time. It's such a great ride. Imagine if True Crime was about something dumb, but taken just as seriously."

3474,"Trillbilly Workers Party podcast is a vulgar, hilarious, insightful Appalachian/Kentucky leftist podcast that started as a reaction to liberal media's ignorance/condescendion of ""Trump Country"" phenomenon and JD Vance's book ""Hillbilly Elegy"". The thesis statement of the show is basically that Appalachia has been, economically, one of the bastions of economic leftism in the United States and was one of the most radical labor regions and consistent Democratic voters from FDR's New Deal until Bill Clinton embraced neoliberalism. 

Essentially, that the answer to ""why do these toothless coal-smudged junkies always vote against their own interests"" was ""they have consistently voted for the """"""""right people"""""""" for almost a century, only for the """"""""right people"""""""" to abandon them."" 

""Why don't these Mountain-Dew mouthed racists do something besides coal mining? I guess they're Noble Savages with too much pride to change"" Coal mining died 20 years ago with mountaintop removal. They aren't refusing to learn other skills, it's just those miraculous neoliberal programs for coding and growing tomatoes and making soap make headlines but never actually stay in Appalachia. The only industry that has managed to consistently stay in and grow is the prison industry."

3679,"**Someplace Underneath** It's a podcast about human trafficking, missing persons and exploitation.  They have a great deep dive about Josh Duggar that I got to from Behind the Bastards.  I also really liked their most recent series on parasocial relationships and child exploitation through social media.  


I also learned that my state still has a law on the books allowing 14 year olds to get married so I need to fucking get on that...


**Morbid**. this is the only true crime podcast I follow but I really enjoy their listener tales and spooky episodes too.  Their episodes on the hillside stranglers actually started to flip my stance on the death penalty.  I also appreciate how they describe murders and serial killers as everyone should; as pieces of shit.  


**Noble Blood** I've never been one to fawn over royals but I love the topics Dana chooses and always find this one very interesting.

The Adventure Zone: the same 3 brothers and their dad play various tabletop RPGs, wildly hilarious and fun but will have you bawling by the end. Each arc is its own separate story that doesn't require looking at other campaigns they've did, with some one offs set in the various established universes.

-a bank robbery gone bad when the robber got stuck in the chimney,

-when one province banned cars

-a Nazi spy who decided to change sides after encountering kind locals

-when Nova Scotia was overrun by an invasion of mice

3921,"""The explorers podcast"" if you like to nerd out over history. The host, Matt, is a wonderful writer and storyteller. I recommend listening to the Endurance serie first as I think it's the best series he has done yet. I started there and am now working my way through the entire catalogue from start to finish."
3922,"From around the 2010-2013 part of time so a little dated but ""Yeah it's that bad"" ran for 150 episodes or so and was great. Just a few  guys watching bad movies then discussing them but it really felt like being at a 24 hour diner talking about a movie with friends.

the oxventure podcast - d&d podcast that is very heavy on the comedy and role playing and not so much on the rules which i know is not for everyone. they also have their spin-off blades in the dark in the same feed.

let's make a music - the hosts tweet out a single word, listeners give them song ideas based on that word and then they write a song based on that.

4122,"If you like short episodes about weird history, I would say Futility Closet.

They are not making any new episodes but they have a pretty large library of past shows."
4123,China History Podcast with Lazlo Montgomery is amazing.
4124,"Science stuff: Lex Fridman, Sean Carroll's Mindscape, The Origins Podcast with Lawrence Krauss.  
  
Humor: The Always Sunny Podcast, Safety Third.  
  
I also like Joe Rogan, but I'm a bit selective when it comes to his guests.  
  
Another controversial podcast that I like is The Jordan B. Peterson podcast. He has some really interesting guests in some rather niche fields, so it's extremely educational. Even if you aren't a fan of JBP's philosophy on self-improvement, you may still enjoy his podcast as he tends to reserve topics like that for his books."
4125,Any of them you like listening to depending on your interests. What kind of question is this?

4127,"The weekly planet podcast. Two Aussies talking about comics, movies and games. Good times"
4128,The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling.
4129,"These are the ones I try to fit in weekly:

Last Pod Cast on the Left - I guess you would call this a true crime pod, but some episodes go off the rails and is fun stuff.

Timesuck - Dan Cummins, comedian, deep dives into a subject. Pod can be very long. I only listen to eps that seem interesting to me.

Scared to Death - Dan again, but with his wife. Dan tells ""scary"" stories found online, and his wife tells fan-sent stories.

Bad Friends/ Yellowbelly (I like Bobby Lee) - It is just whatever they decide to talk about.

I also listen to some dnd pod cast, but they are not always weekly episodes.

I enjoy macabre pods. Neat to learn about off subjects or learn about different ideologies."
4130,Swindled is really good
4131,"Late to the party and I have very specific interests but these have never let me down as far as content and quality. 

Swindled - deadpan and sarcastic telling of mostly white collar crimes and greed. I've never laughed so hard. Bonus it's not usually gruesome so I don't have to scramble to shut it off if my kids come around. 

Ologies - various scientists and experts are interviewed about their topic of interest. I started listening because there are a lot of animal experts in the backlog but I found myself interested in a ton of things I didn't expect. It's always nice to listen to people talk about things they're passionate about. 

Last Podcast on the Left - the humor will not be for everyone and earlier episodes are rough around the edges but if you're into true crime, cryptids, aliens, conspiracy or spooky history, you can't go wrong. Especially love their series on Jonestown, The Donner Party, Mormonism and my personal favorite, Gef the talking Mongoose. 

Casefile - if you are into true crime and you want something more serious then this is your show. Episodes are long and full of information and presented by a single host with no humor involved. The Jonestown series here is fantastic as well but my favorite was the extended series on the East Area Rapist (Golden State Killer/Original Nightstalker).

Honorable mention for the Science of Birds which is newer to me but full of lots of cool info about different species of birds and their behaviors."

The Far Meridian-a sort of hear warming absurdist drama about an introvert who lives in a teleporting lighthouse. It's really good at catching some human troubles and highlights.

Wolverine The Long Night and The Lost Trail-are also really cool and make a fun take on a superhero drama in a neat way that doesn't really require much background information on the story... But that knowledge can help reinforce some of the characters or interactions."

4147,"[Startalk](https://startalkmedia.com/) \- Neil DeGrasse Tyson and Chuck Nice (comedian) or a guest host will talk about different topics regarding space and science. It's very lighthearted and digestible. My favorite episodes are the *Cosmic Queries* episodes where listeners will send in questions for Neil and/or his guests to answer.

[Lore](https://www.lorepodcast.com/episodes) \- Aaron Mahnke hosts and discusses various strange facts and urban legends or myths from around the world. It's not so much a horror podcast by any means but more of a ""weird history"" podcast where he talks about strange happenings from the past, mysteries or coincidences, or other obscure and weird facts that you probably haven't ever heard about.

[Myths and Legends](https://www.mythpodcast.com/) \- Jason Weiser retells classic myths and fairy tales in a lighthearted and approachable way. It's very entertaining and is usually age appropriate for everyone but some episodes will come with a warning about adult content.

[The NoSleep Podcast](https://www.thenosleeppodcast.com/) \-  this one actually got its start from reddit and the r/nosleep sub. It's a horror podcast where original short stories are acted out through full production by voice actors and complete with sound effects. It's very high quality and professional."

4160,Build me a brewery
4161,"No love for American History Tellers here?! I really enjoy it. It's a history podcast that does a series on several episodes on one event, for instance, the Civil War, but instead of telling you everything dryly, he's reenacting scenes between people who were there (famous people in history) or people who could have been there (average Joe's and Jill's and how they thought about the goings on as it happened). I really enjoyed his series on the development of the National Parks, and the Lewis and Clark expedition, among others."

4170,"Scared to death or Timesuck, Scared to death is an excellent scary story podcast and Timesuck is like a comedy history lesson. Both hosted by a comedian and his wife co-hosts the scary one"
4171,I've started _Factually!_ with Adam Conover and it's a very thought provoking way to learn deeper about some of the topics we care about most
4172,"In Our Time, BBC Radio 4"
4173,"My Brother, My Brother, and Me"
4174,"For spanish speakers: *Radio Ambulante* (by NPR). Fascinating stories from latin america.

Most of their audience is learning spanish as a second language, actually. Got that from a poll NPR made themselves."

4179,Net Positive with John Crist
4180,"Also Levar Burton Reads! Levar Burton the narrator behind Reading Rainbow (and actor best known for his role as Geordi LaForge in Star Trek TNG) narrates his favorite short stories, often but not always from the scifi/fantasy/speculative fiction realm but frequently not, and al WA ys thought provoking. I could listen to that man read the label on a cleaning chemical bottle and it would still relax and entertain me."
4181,Breaking Points with Krystal and Saagar is probably the only podcast about news and politics that I think anyone from any political ideology can listen to. They do a really good job of sifting through bs in the news and making you realize that we all have a lot more in common than traditional media outlets would like us to believe.
4182,Don't be sour podcast
4183,Aunty Donna podcast and those conspiracy guys are always good.
4184,"The Downbeat, a hilarious music podcast"
4185,"My favorite podcast for a while now has been Thumb Cramps. It's a video game podcast but the hosts are by far some of the funniest and most entertaining on anything I've listened to. The same guys do one called Baseless Speculation where they watch trailers for upcoming movies and talk about what they think the plot will be, and another called Plumbing the Death Star but that one's a little more freeform and ridiculous.

Also big big big shoutout to Hey Fam..! definitely one that I personally relate to very often, and that I've recommended to a lot a my friends, though I don't think any of them have taken me up on it, so it's hard for me to gauge how it fairs with an audience that isn't just me and the rest of the people in the discord."
4186,"50 Things that Made the Modern Economy is also a great podcast with short episodes that talk about (100, there are two seasons now) things we take for granted that had large impacts on our way of life and economy. Things included range from concrete to the contraceptive pill. I am always fascinated how many ways things have fundamentally changed our way of life that I never considered. 

Perun (https://www.youtube.com/@PerunAU/videos) is my personal favorite who does hour long video presentations (which you can listen to only just fine) that cover defense and economics with a focus on the situation in Ukraine. It has been very helpful for better understanding the situation there and all the elements at play in a very matter of fact and citation rich environment."
4187,"Trash Taste

3 dudes living in Japan labelled as an ""anime"" podcast but in actuality don't really talk that much about anime. Garnt, Joey and Connor have great chemistry with each other.

Haven't tuned in in a while but I had a lot of fun when I was listening to them"
4203,The Lore Lodge with Aiden Mattis and Aiden Thornberry. It's a mix of strange missing persons cases and folklore/cryptic stuff from the perspec give of skeptics.

4213,A bit of an older one sleepy cabin is super funny if you like smiling friends or internet humor it's a great podcast
4214,"Judge John Hodgman

You might recognize this small-time background actor from roles as the PC guy in the old Apple commecerials, and from the Daily Show awhile ago. 

But that's not where his true passion lies. His passion is justice and metering it out between everyday people with sometimes very strange disagreements. 

It's a very wholesome and often laugh out loud show, most times making me think about how I handle disagreements in my own life and how I can be better about it."
4215,"Old Gods of Appalachia. I love this one. I have played a lot of Call of Cthulhu and read a lot of stories that take place in the back woods of Appalachia, where cultists and witches and insular moon shiners make folks disappear for asking too many questions.

This is a nice subversion of those tropes by making the outcasts, cultists, witches and criminals the good guys."
4216,Old gods of Appalachia.  It's a horror anthology and the writer and narrator is fantastic.  It gets legit creepy at times

Black Box Down. Gus and Chris go through aviation accidents and go through the measures put in place that make aviation safer."
4222,"Head In The Office : a somewhat new podcast that covers recent political events in the US. I've only started listening to them but, I can't recommend them enough to people. It's such a funny and informative way to digest complex political issues going on."
4223,"History of Literature podcast is often good. I wish I knew what the music is! Underunderstood and Endless Thread are similar in premise, looking for internet mysteries as rabbit holes to dive down. Yet they have very different styles.

More technical podcasts: Sean Carroll's Mindscape is good for insight into the nature of the universe from a philosophically oriented physicist who is good at finding interesting guests for deep conversations. There is a new genre, technical podcasts focused on AI, Robot Brains is an example.

For music: In the groove Jazz and beyond is good. Sticky Notes for classical music. Good old Grateful Deadcast is amazingly well done. The Beethoven Files analyzes individual pieces in depth, useful for learning what Beethoven was actually doing."

They read chunks of either a self-important author's manifesto (Sean Penn writes books by the way) or tackle something self-published from Amazon or [fanfic.net](https://fanfic.net) (there is a billion dollar ""cozy-mystery"" book industry out there, that makes me sad to work a 9 to 5).

My other favorite podcast is distractible by Markiplier, Muyskeurm, and lordminion777. Two times a week they post and they just talk about whatever the topic is, or play whatever vocal game the current host wants to play.

Men in Blazers Podcast- Premier League/USMNT recaps with a surprising amount of comedy for being hosted by the producer of Jeopardy and a journalist

4298,"**Everything Everywhere Daily**

It's wonderful!  He's been releasing new episodes every single day since 2020.  Each episode is about 10-15 minutes long, they are well researched, entertaining, and you never know what the topic is going to be.  Some of the recent episodes have been:

Black Holes

Cleopatra

The Cuban Missile Crisis

Artificial Sweeteners

The Siege of Baghdad"
4299,"I'm late to this but I like heavy weight it's about an investigative journalist who will look into any issues.  Some of them are small like finding a photo that someone took 20 years ago to some pretty deep topics.  The host is really funny.  

Also, criminal it talks about past crimes related things and what happened.  It's not murders.  One episode was how a women got away with saying she killed someone due to her period.  To an episode of who stole the ruby red slippers or what happens to your body after you die kind of thing"

It's the first podcast to be completely run by, produced by and edited by an AI, it has complete access to hosts Will Sasso and Chad Kultgen emails, phone calls, text messages, browser history, receipts and locations to cater a show specifically for them to host. It is the funniest, most bizarre and super informative of how AI can and will evolve while also coming up with insane bits for Will Sasso. They also have a patreon channel where you get an extra segment at the end of their weekly show, access to the discord channel where the AI is always listening, you're able to pitch it bits and segments and they also do random but great commentary tracks for movies or music. If there's any Ten Minute Podcast fan out there, this is a treat for us. Give it a watch/listen on YouTube or wherever you get your podcasts from and if need be, force your friends and loved ones to watch until they become fans and eventually we'll all be POD's (Pals of Dudesy) together in this weird and fucked up time to be alive"

4319,"The Mark Howley Show if you're into interview style and hearing about real people overcoming adversities, building businesses, addiction and recovery. It's a really good show that I stumbled onto about 6 months ago. I believe that the host Mark Howley built one of the largest packaging companies in the United States everything from coffee bags, dog food bags basically any consumer good this guys company did the packaging for both major brands to small mom and pop stuff. It was called Pacific bag. From his bio I believe he retired and sold the company for some crazy high 9 figure number but now he just does consulting and gives speeches and decided to start a podcast like a year ago or so.

Anyway I frickin love it and he is a great interviewer. Most of the time the guests are very interesting but just normal average people.

4326,"If you're in to college football, I highly recommend Split Zone Duo.  It's probably the most insightful look at the whole sport out there with legitimate discussions about scheme, behind the scene machinations of coaches and administrators, and legit journalism that does it's best to cover all 130 schools competing at the FBS level.

It's a far cry from the normal CFB ""journalism"" that covers the same 15 schools with a reasonable shot at making the playoff while throwing some crumbs to everyone else.  I guess that stuff is great if you're a fan of one of those schools, but like I said, there are 115 other fanbases out there.

I like them enough that I pay for their patreon to get an extra couple deep dive episodes per week, and I don't pay for *anything* content-wise online."

Best of all, he's never fighting his guests. Everyone on the podcast has a technology he believes in and did research on so he could ask really good questions"
4330,"Strange Arrivals - podcast about anything UFO related. Great interviews with witnesses, old recordings of people with knowledge on the subject and other guests with curious takes. The host takes a scientific approach and seems objective in his assessments."
4331,"i've been quite invested in Critical Role for over a year. I'm halfway through season 2, and my car rides to and from work have been less boring (music is fine but it gets you going only so far)

It's a dnd adventure: first season is about Vox Machina (already established group of adventurers) who save the world.

It's far from perfect but it's the next best thing, it's really FUN, the guys playing are having fun, and you listener will have fun with them (most of the time, there are some people ""overacting"" who i kinda found annoying, but maybe that's just a me problem plus they get better in season 2)

s2 is about the mighty nein, who are just starting out at lvl2 (idk where lvl1 went, they started at 2, they did some solo stuff i think? which was not included in the podcast)  


Also i'm saving this post for podcasts to listen to when Critical Role is over (i already have s2 of dungeons and daddies to listen)"

Look for podcasts from local cultural, nonprofit, or professional organizations, and learn interesting things you never would have known otherwise about your city and the people who live in it.  Stay away from the ones produced by news and radio stations.  They just recycle material from their other platforms."
4341,"There are many great podcasts out there, so it's hard to pick just one. However, I can recommend ""StartUp Podcast"" by Gimlet Media. This podcast is a series about what it's really like to start a business. It provides valuable insights, candid stories, and lessons from entrepreneurs who have gone through the process. It's not only informative but also engaging and entertaining. Keep in mind, though, that podcast preferences are subjective, so explore different genres and topics to find what resonates with you."

4464,The Greg Cote Show Podcast featuring Greg Cote
4465,"Ear Hustle. It's about San Quentin prison life and later season explore life after prison for formerly incarcerated individuals. I went in not thinking I would like it because of the population it focuses on but it hooked me from the start. It doesn't go out of it's way to forgive or criminalize the people it features though ti's obviously a podcast meant to discuss incarcerated people's lives so they come across better than they would with a different lens.

I also really like Snap Judgement. The show typicality covers one person or event and cover a variety of topics. Examples are an interview and discussion of the young girl who was the sole survivor of a plane crash in the rainforest and how she saved herself, people's experiences in the CA wildfires, this disabled man who created a giant Barbie/Gi Joe landscape in his backyard (it was made into a movie), and woman's experiences working in an artillery factory and what happened when they was an accident, etc. There are serious, funny, and heartwarming stories. You never know what the focus will be. They do an offshoot Podcast called ""Spooked"" that is about scary stories.

He investigates the event and talks with other actors with similar stories. It's really heartfelt and charming."

\- Cinephile with Adnan Virk. If you love movies look no further, Adnan is fantastic host that keeps everything very fresh and great at interviewing. He really knows how to elicit a great response or story from actors, directors, etc. Just a positively infectious and knowledgeable hosts that fanboys over the same films/personalities we do.

\- EarHustle. Produced by inmates at San Quentin Correctional Facility. Fantastic insight into a world most people know very little about, very informative.

Nice little ~30 minutes episodes that can be crammed full of interesting information but so easy to listen to. I especially enjoyed the multi part serious on the history of well - alternative music. Pretty crazy how it all fed together and evolved.


Also Blowback. It's currently three seasons of deep dives on conflicts the United States has been involved in and the factors that led to them. Super fascinating."

4530,"I've listened to tons of podcasts during jobs where I've had time to kill, and I also listen while driving. Here are some of my favourites from throughout the years that I can think of off the top of my head. Probably missing a few:  


**Boonta Vista** -- Australian comedy podcast. Stumbled upon it myself and I look forward to every episode, it's fucking hilarious.  
  
**My Brother, My Brother, and Me** -- extremely well known comedy podcast between three brothers, they listen to problems from their listeners and give advice. They are not good at giving advice.  
  
**The Besties** -- Featuring two of the brothers from the podcast above, four game journalists review video games new and old, very funny and their taste in games aligns really well with mine so I'm always getting great recommendations and reviews out of it.  
  
**Beautiful/Anonymous** -- One phone call, one hour. Any topic. The host accepts any callers and you hear some of the funniest and most heart wrenching stories from real people, can get really heavy sometimes but it's a great listen.
  
**Hey Riddle Riddle** - An improv podcast where three hosts try to solve riddles that devolve into hysterical improv skits. I've had to pull over to the side of the road while driving before because I was laughing so hard.
  
**Reply All** - The podcast isn't airing anymore, but some of the episodes from years ago were some of the most interesting podcasts I've ever listened to. Any of the episodes that feature the Super Tech Support segments were incredible, people call in with their obscure unsolvable tech problems and the hosts use their media industry connections to sometimes go as far as speaking to actual CEOs to try to solve these insane problems. Some of the best Super Tech Support episodes: ""The Case of the Phantom Caller"", ""Brian vs Brian"", ""The Case of the Missing Hit"", ""The Woman in the Air Conditioner"", ""At Worlds End""  
The show was one of my absolute favourites in general, the Super Tech Support segments were just standouts in particular. Forever sad that the podcast had to come to an end :(  
  

**Til Death Do Us Blart** - The most deranged premise for a podcast I have ever seen. 5 friends enter into an eternal commitment to review specifically the movie ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2"" every thanksgiving for the rest of their lives. When they die, they are to be replaced by new members to keep the podcast running forever. It's been airing for 8 years now, and for the first 5 years most of them had never even seen the first movie."

4569,"Be Here Now with Ram Dass
Changed my life. The podcast is made up of spiritual lectures done by Ram Dass. Up into the 200s at the moment, the lectures seem to be a capsule in time which take you back to a sentiment and spirit of the 60s in the beginning but come right up to his later years in the 2000s. Ram Dass, formerly Richard Alpert, was the professor who along with Tim Leary, popularized the psychedelic movement and then were thumped out of Harvard. Ram Dass tied his spiritual journey to psychedelics and moved past that journey, when he found a guru in India. He emerged changed by the experience and became a teacher on the human experience. The podcasts are warm reminder of humanity and what it means to be on a journey."
4570,"Unexplained with Richard McLean Smith is Incredible!  His voice is so soothing and smooth, very relaxing and awesome content.  Start with Season 6, episode 23. It's a good episode that gives a solid feel for what the other 200 episodes are mostly like.

4630,I tell everyone to listen to [This Is Hell](https://thisishell.com/). It's a podcast/radio show out of Chicago that has interviews with journalists and academics that you would otherwise not hear on mass media news outlets mostly for their leftist or otherwise critical views of social and political problems within America. It has been on the air for 30 years and blows my mind on a regular basis. They have had big names like Noam Chomsky on in the past.

4635,"Shout-outs to my two favorite shows- both are not for everyone, but if they are your cup of tea, you might love them a lot!

I love the Campaign Podcast: Chicago improvisers playing long-form role-playing games. There's a long Star Wars Arc, and now they're a hundred or so episodes into Skyjacks, which is a queer airship pirate Decemberists-informed folktale-punk adventure about friendship and the stars falling. It usually makes me laugh out loud, and it's provoked soulful tears more than a few times. Always good, often spectacular. 

I also have a real love for ""Jay & Miles X-Plain the X-Men""; it's a deep dive into the history of the X-Men (mostly in the comics.). It's loving, candid, funny, irreverent and kind. Both hosts have very personal connections to the source material, and both are willing to call out the trash and enjoy the trash as well. I think you'll know within thirty seconds or so if it's the show for you; the cold opens are excellent and absurd. Also a very queer show, and serious about the way the mutant metaphor played out in the past and might play out these days. 

If anybody tries one of these out, it will be like I've introduced you to a friend. <3"

4698,"Depends on the type of podcast you're into! I like fictional story podcasts, personally, so I would highly recommend The Magnus Archives, and Alice Isn't Dead. They both involve the supernatural and overarching baddies that you don't discover right away, baddies that you *do* recognize right away and are pretty \*chef's kiss\* and the main character is just along for the ride whether they like it or not.

For true-story podcasts, I don't listen to many, but I'm a fan of Cadaver Gals! Interesting and weird ways that people have died throughout history/modern day, told by a trio of friends being fun and flirty while they tell you about topics like how a man made a DIY catheter and died from it. The stark contrast between the morbid topics and pure unhinged energy is so fun."

4700,"I got two:

1) History of Ideas - This is a phenomenal deep dive into the political philosophy of the modern state. It's done by David Runciman who teaches at Cambridge. Really engaging analysis that covers ppl I'd heard of (Hobbes, Marx, Tocqueville, Rawls) and a lot I'd never really encountered (Wollstonecraft, Fanon, Luxembourg).

2) HIST 119: The Civil War and Reconstruction Era, 1845-1877(from Open Yale Courses): this one is just a recoding of classes taught by David Blight, who is a fantastic historian. Really gets into the why of the civil war and where it came from. Like, I always knew the civil war as about slavery and that the North one but after this I really knew why it was about slavery and also how the South lost but also didn't.

both of these are less History Channel and more collegiate lecture series. Which is not to say they are boring or dry! I found them just as (if not more) engaging than something like Dan Carlin Hardcore History or Mike Duncan's History of Rome / Revolutions but also more substantial; really going in depth on the why of things and with more emphasis on direct source material."

Then I came across some clips from ""Bad Friends"" with Bobby Lee and Andrew Santino. I never really checked out Bobby Lee stuff because before I felt like he was just this wildcard crazy guy and it didn't feel like it was for me. Then I saw those clips and saw how Santino interacts with Bobby and their dynamic is pretty great. They're legit funny most of the time and they added in ""Rudy"" as a side person and having her as part of the team made it even better. So anyway, if you check out some clips on Bad Friends on youtube you might find it's funny. I only really watch this, maybe some Conan clips.

The single best podcast I have ever heard is *In the Dark, Season 2* about the wrongful conviction of Curtis Flowers.  The podcasters don't just tell the story, they make the story.  They actually move to Winona , Mississippi to do an incredibly deep dive into the story.  It's heartbreaking at times.

I also really like *Unraveled, Experts on Trial* which completely debunks most forensic ""sciences.""  And I put sciences in quotes because in most cases there's little or no science to back up most forensic evidence analysis.  It tells about 8 stories of innocent people convicted on the basis of faulty science and ""expert"" testimony.

""Just hope that you are never accused of a crime that an expert says you committed."""
4810,"I've enjoyed both seasons of World's Greatest Con so far, and they're just now dropping the third. It's a magician who does a deep dive into scams throughout history, and digs into why they work.

Another favorite is Knowledge Fight, where a couple of comedians talk about Alex Jones's various shows and legal appearances. They're actually very insightful and pretty damn hilarious.

And last but not least, Citation Needed. A bunch of comedians take a subject, read an article on Wikipedia about it, and pretend they're experts. It never fails to make me chuckle."

Worth listening to because of the amount of laughs 

2. The Modern Mann
Magazine show in the form of a podcast. You have a presenter completing his monthly challenge (they differ each month! He once had to cook up a 3 course meal made out of insects for him and the other presenter to enjoy. Another time he built his own escape room. Both very funny). The main bit is an interview of people with fascinating stories / interesting lives (the guy who got lost at sea for 24+ hours, a child soldier, guy who had false accusations of him plastered all over the Internet). Last bit is sex tips from Alix Fox, educational while funny at the same time!

The storytelling is incredible, Haley and Gus always manage to create amazing party chemistry with their players, I really cannot sing their praises enough. 
You don't have to listen chronologically, each arc is standalone (minus two sequel arcs), but they all contribute to building the UC world and adding to its lore. Some arcs are silly goofy fun times, like the level one sportsball Arc 4, some are high stakes action adventure like the level 15 save the world Arc 3, some are intense high drama like the mixed level political intrigue of Arc 8, there's honestly something for everyone.

 - the dollop: comedisn Dave Anthony does research on a silly or terrible topic of american history and reads the story to his comedian friend Gareth Reynolds, who goes in completely blind and reacts to the story being told to him. Very amazing chemistry between the 2.

 - The Danny Brown show: Danny Brown is a famous rapper but is known to be extremely funny and charismatic and has built ties in the comedy world, and now has his own podcast hosted by YHM (tom segura's company). Listening to Danny regale us with tales of his youth in the hood, his struggles and his absolutely hilarious takes on relationships is incredible.

5044,"The only one I've ever truly enjoyed and gotten something out of was By The Book. They recently ended it and started a new podcast called How To Be Fine, so you might have to search for the new title to find the backlog.

5057,"In The Dark

Truly fantastic investigative journalism with interviews from people involved in these cases. Season 1 is about a 1989 child abduction that mainly focused on how the police/investigators significantly mishandled the investigation and the creation of the sex offender registry and ""stranger danger"". Season 2 is about Curtis Flowers, a black man in Mississippi accused of murdering 4 people and was tried a total of 6 times by the county District Attorney, 4 of which were overturned, and all the while kept him in prison (on death row) for over 20 years. The podcast actually had a significant impact on Curtis Flower's case."

Anyway, he hosts this podcast and brings in two quests; an expert historian on that episodes subject, and a comedian who wants to learn. Hilarity ensues, it's good fun.

I'd suggest the Boudica and the Mansa Musa episodes to start, I had a lot of fun listening to those."

- Stuff the British Stole. Looks at a specific artefact every episode, discusses the history, controversies, what's going on with it now, and how it impacts the original culture. 

- Dig: The Ring In. About a famous part of Australian criminal history, involving a horse race in the 80s that had even some global effects in the end. Each episode, you can't believe some of the stuff that actually happened. Listened to this while on a road trip with my mum, she remembered bits and pieces of it in the media at the time. (Went to listen to the next part of the series about police corruption in QLD [Dog: Sirens are Coming], but that got too close to home for her)

- The Infinite Monkey Cage. Prof Brian Cox, Robert Ince,  panels of experts and comedians on all topics of science from black holes, does time exist, to the psychology of conspiracy theorists."

5118,"It's Probably Not Aliens

A podcast which goes through the claims of the TV show Ancient Aliens and debunks them.

It's worth listening to because it's fun to laugh at the obviously dubious claims made by the History Channel show and you get to learn about the actual history behind places/artifacts of ancient cultures. There are also episodes about the lives, and sometimes crimes, of the originators of the Ancient Alien ideas and why they should not be viewed as any sort of trustworthy sources of information."

[5-4](https://www.fivefourpod.com)

>> 5-4 is a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks. It's a progressive and occasionally profane take on the ideological battles at the heart of the Court's most important landmark cases, and an irreverent tour of all the ways in which the law is shaped by politics.
>>
>>Listen each week as hosts Peter, Michael, and Rhiannon dismantle the Justices' legal reasoning on hot-button issues like affirmative action, gun rights, and campaign finance, and use dark humor to reveal the high court's biases.

For example the internment camps in the US during WWII and how we lost 32 nuclear bombs (not at one time) and almost ""nuked"" a town in South Carolina during Operation Crome Dome.

Let's Not Meet - Narrated true stories of narrow misses with dangerous or creepy people. One of my favorites. Host shares a name with Andrew Tate, but is not THAT Andrew Tate.

Odd Trails - Same host as above, reading paranormal true(with a grain of salt) stories and discussing with his co-host at the end (sorry, I don't remember your name, but you have an excellent voice!)

Noble Blood - Focuses on a person/event in history, usually involving murder or death. Very good storytelling and voice.

Lore - Love his voice. Topics are myths and lore throughout history. Sometimes I doze off to this.

It's Always Sunny - Charlie, Rob, and Glenn loosely discussing IASIP while sharing irrelevant side stories. I'm new to this one, but love it so far.

Not a huge fan if 99% Invisible for some reason. I think because it involves interviews. I think most people would like it, though."

>There's an idea about how children learn to read that's held sway in schools for more than a generation -- even though it was proven wrong by cognitive scientists decades ago. Teaching methods based on this idea can make it harder for children to learn how to read. In this podcast, host Emily Hanford investigates the influential authors who promote this idea and the company that sells their work. It's an expose of how educators came to believe in something that isn't true and are now reckoning with the consequences -- children harmed, money wasted, an education system upended.

It is only 6 episodes and available on every podcast platform. It's especially relevant to parents of young kids, but it is fascinating even if you don't."

S-town

Serial (first season)

X-plain the X-men

Scaredy Cats podcast Horror Show

Too Scary Didn't Watch

Wolverine: the long night

Marvels (a radioplay adaptation of a graphic novel that works surprisingly well)

Newcomers

Dolly Parton's America

Thrilling Adventure Hour

Meet my friends the friends

Buffering the Vampire Slayer

My Dad Wrote a Porno

Answer Me This 

Bundyville

Rabbit Hole

Bugs Need Heroes


We binged S-town on a roadtrip. Newcomers is two comedians watching Star Wars and later Lord of the Rings and reacting to it. Some of those are recap podcasts and there are tons of those. They sometimes work even if you haven't seen the show. Dolly Parton's America is a radiolab spin off. 

Bundyville is excellent. Marvels, Wolverine, and Thrilling Adventure Hour are audio plays. My Dad Wrote a Porno is NSFW but not erotic. The host found his father's self published and very poorly written erotica. It was my gym podcast to motivate me to go. 

I only listened to the first season of Serial. I heard the second season was not as good. 

Meet My Friends The Friends is a parody of tv recap podcasts. 

All those other podcasts can also be binged if you are into them, but that shorter list kind of lead into the next episode a little better as they aren't changing topic every sixty minutes. 


Doughboys occasionally does themed months (Munch Madness in March) and those could also be similarly binged."

Their ""main"" podcast My Brother, My Brother and Me (MBMBaM) is a comedy podcast where they give advice to listeners that email problems in, mixed with plenty of other silly bits and the greatest podcast within a podcast ever. They have over 10 years worth of episodes on this one. They also did 6 episodes of a MBMBaM TV show that's free to watch on VRV, it's the funniest reality shit I've ever seen.


The Adventure Zone is their DnD podcast with their dad Clint, they have several campaigns completed on there but the Balance campaign (the first one) is the biggest and is being made into graphic novels. 


Sawbones is Justin and his wife, a doctor, talking about medical history and the things it did wrong.


Wonderful! Is Griffin and his wife talking about the little things that make life great. It's a shorter podcast if you're in a hurry but still very good.


Travis usually has a podcast or two of his own going on, but he starts and stops a lot more than his brothers, so I honestly couldn't tell you what other projects he has actively going, but they are always entertaining when he does."

* nymphowars: just absolute psychosis, off the walls humor by two lovely trans women who just like to talk a lot of shit and abuse the soundboard. Makes my days better.

* the bald and the beautiful: two drag queens who are just hilarious. Super off the wall and funny.

* where do we begin: streamers that I love who just decided to do a podcast for the fans that want extra content. Not sure how else to explain it but it's a very specific brand of humor

Two guys discuss cancelled movies from well known franchises/directors and why they didn't make it past early scripts.

He was in captivity with James Foley, the American Journalist that was beheaded in a video released by ISIS. The podcast looks into what happened to John Cantlie, since he stopped appearing in videos shortly before the airstrike of Mosul 2017. It's fascinating, heart-wrenching, and beautifully told. I highly recommend."
5477,"All of the Serial podcasts by Sarah Koenig are incredible. Their season on crime and punishment in America should be required listening for all Americans.

S-Town, by Brian Reed, about a reclusive genius in a small town in Mississippi is amazing.

Myths and Legends - pretty much what you think it's about. It's been awhile since I've listened but I loved the entire Arthurian legend series, and almost all of the Greek stuff as well as the occasional Native American and Japanese folklore stuff. It's like a bed time story!  
  
Critical Role - if you like DND you've almost certainly heard of it. If not, it's a bunch of voice actors playing dungeons and dragons and it is fun. They also have video too but the content does well with podcast medium.  
  
Stuff you should know - already been mentioned, but just 2 dudes that research a topic and come back to talk about what they learned on the show"
5509,"My Brother, My Brother and Me is probably the funniest podcast.

3 brothers give advice on questions sent in by the audience. Super funny. They also spend time answering yahoo answers and reading wiki-how articles"

It's an incredible podcast where each episode is told through first person accounts. The episodes are about things that have happened to the person that would be unbelievable if you weren't the one who witnessed the event."

Smartless - comedic interviews of famous people hosted by Will Arnett, Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes. ~1hr each. 

The Daily - NYT longer form stories. Great for morning listens. 20-35 mins each (Sundays are longer). 

Up First - NPR daily news in the morning. 13-15 mins. 

Hard Fork - NYT tech podcast (mainly AI at the moment). 1-1.4 hrs each. 

Darknet Diaries - interviews with hackers, pentesters, fraudsters, scammers. 1-1.4 hrs each. 

99% invisible - deep dives into design topics (I'm not a designer and I love these). Great to fall asleep to. 30-60 mins. 

Dan Carlin's Hardcore History - epic, multi series podcast on historical topics. Start with blueprint for Armageddon. Only podcast I've paid $ for. Each series is 8-15 hours."

5518,"If you're into D&D but want something beyond actual-plays (of which I have a few recommendations), check out *Kill Every Monster*. Yes, there's an actual-play segment, but it's a show about the lore--real-world inspiration as well as in-game history--and mechanics on everything from nothics to hags to couatls and devas. The actual-play is more a testing range."
5519,"Black box down is one that I'll always recommend, I feel they have a good balance of joking around and genuinely interesting content, plus the fact that each episode ends with a positive change in the aviation industry is pretty cool."

5538,Shit town is great.
5539,"Depends entirely on what you're into. 

I like Baseball, so I listen to the BBTN Pod and Talkin' Baseball. They're put on by people who work in the industry as reporters, in the case of BBTN, or fans and former players, in the case of Talkin' Baseball. 

I also like D&D, so (if you do too) you probably know where this is going. Critical Role just about single handedly brought about a cultural resurgence of D&D. There's literally months worth of content to listen to over the course of hundreds of 4+ hour long episodes, one shots, and spin offs. 

I also like to get my news from Podcasts, so the NYT The Daily, BBC Global News Podcast, and just about anything NPR puts our are all top quality. 

I don't care much for True Crime, so despite knowing that there is a whole genre of excellently produced and created podcasts, I'm never going to listen to them because nothing about murder mysteries interests me. 

So, find your genre and just explore it. Like, D&D also has Dimension 20 and Not Another D&D Podcast. Both excellent shows, but not something I've got into because CR takes up so much time."

He interviews other actors who were on band of brothers, casting agents, and anyone else who has experienced rejection in the entertainment industry. He structures the whole thing like a mystery podcast, trying to solve the question of whether Tom Hanks really said that. In the last episode, he talks to Tom Hanks. The whole thing wraps up nicely and is really well done"

5608,"Behind The Bastards is, in my opinion, one of the best out there. It's fun, it's energetic, and I've learned so much from it.

The concept is finding bastards through history (Alex Jones, Hitler, Kellogg) and taking a look through their life to sort of see what happened to make them the way they were, and what they did during their life that makes them a bastard."

Nothing information or learning about the world but it's a podcast about the host paired up with one of her friends, family members, boyfriend, etc talking and discussing posts from other subreddits such as ""Am I The Asshole"". Hearing those stories have actually made me a lot more mindful of how I talk to people and/or handle situations. Highly recommended. Plus it's funny hearing all the crazy shit people do"
5639,Grandpa and Chill podcast. I don't remember how I stumbled upon it but it is a grandfather talking to his grandson and his grandsons friends. It's the only time you hear conversations that bridge the divide of old and young and it's really cool and powerful. Nothing makes me laugh but also feel so interested as this show. I feel like boomers and millennials are always screaming at each other and it's just interesting to hear such different points of view come together.

5710,"Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast.

Gilbert Gottfried and his co-host, Frank Santopadre, had done such a great service for old, and all but forgotten Hollywood. Interviews with directors, actors, musicians, voice artists, television hosts, etc. Frank and Gilbert not only gave all of us a true gift, but many of their guests as well. Many of these people they interviewed like Carl Reiner, Peter Marshall, Bill Macy, Al Jaffee, Dick Van Dike, Sonny Fox, and John Astin, were all NONAGINARIANS at the time, and many of their guests had dissapeared from the public eye DECADES ago.

I've no doubt that some of these guests had all but given up on life, and were just waiting for death to find them, but as the interview progressed, you could PRACTICALLY FEEL the spark of life being reignited in these golden age icons getting one more day in the spotlight to share their wisdom, knowledge, and experiences. 

There were times while listening to some of these guests, (and I KNOW Gilbert and Frank had these moments as well) that I felt like I was a kid, sitting on the floor listening to an elder speak, and I was HONORED to be able to listen.

There were PLENTY of laughs to be had as well, as we also got to hear Gilbert's impressions of Old Groucho Marx, Jerry Seinfeld, Humphrey Bogart and others that will take you back to his days of getting to sit in during the news from The Howard Stern Show. As well as moments and stories that would give you chills. People often give Howard Stern praise for his interviews [especially Howard Himself, seeing as how he went as far as to publish a book of interview transcripts to PROVE it's true (such a fall from grace if you ask me)] but many of Gilbert and Frank's guests were truly inspiring, and they were all beautiful. I CAN NOT give Frank and Gilbert enough praise for what they did. 


The podcast ran from 2014 to 2022, so don't judge the early episodes too harshly for audio and technical problems. Even Gilbert had his doubts about getting this podcast to work, but eventually he came to acknowledge that what they were doing was a good thing.


RIP GILBERT GOTTFRIED (02/28/1955 - 04/12/2022) you truly were taken from us TOO SOON."

They're very open and honest, they have guest on their podcast sometimes, both male and female, and they hear them out, and are very respectful of their opinions. They share some wild stories, and its a very entertaining podcast if you're big on sex positivity and things such as that.

""In about 10 minutes, listeners can learn something new every day on various subjects, including history, science, geography, mathematics, and technology, as well as biographies of some of the world's most interesting people.""

I **love** this podcast. Short form of only about 10 minutes per episode, with a great host who is right on point. Topics are always interesting and well presented. 

I listen to a lot of podcasts and frequently ditch shows as they seem to inevitably become more about hearing the host banter than what the show was originally about. Two plus years in and this podcast is true to form. Awesome podcast."

6233,"- Hardcore History. Very long, but very deep-dive into fascinating things.

- History of the world in 100 Objects. Short episodes. Talks about human history from the very beginning until the current day, focusing on one cool museum object in each episode. Gives a great macro-level view of humanity. 

- Hidden Brain. For modern and cool psychology.

- Rough Translation. Exposes small nift cultural differences between cultures.

- Economist Radio. I like ""the Economist"", and their audio offerings are great to keep up on things happening in the world. They have different 'shows'. Babbage (the tech one) is good. They also have ""editor's picks' where they read 4 articles from their print edition. Often great mixtures of interesting topics from all around the world that you didn't know were happening and interesting.

- Freakonomics / Planet Money. Both shine a light on how the economy - for better or for worse - works."

It's easy to fall in love with the characters, it's honest about tackling your own bad traits and improving, and it's a genuinely enjoyable experience. 

I know it's not ""worthwhile"" for educational purposes, but there's genuine value in doing something to enjoy doing it and I think this podcast made me remember that.

British history podcast - made by one guy, who loves British history and goes through it in so much detail, but in such an interesting way.

Fall of civilisations podcast - the episodes are meaty, but this guy goes into detail about how civilisations grew, became powerful, and ultimately fell. Great and immersive.

The Magnus Archives - without a doubt the best horror podcast I have heard listened to. Full to the brim with all manner of horror stories, all mostly self contained in each episode."

However, the Internet is full of conflicting accounts, and it's entirely possible you might hear me say something about a person or an event that contradicts something you heard or read elsewhere. If so, feel free to bring any discrepancy to my attention. Just remember - I'm not wrong. It's just the way I heard it...""

Black box down: it's two dudes ( one is really into aviation and is a pilot now and the other one is into it too but isn't as knowledgeable on the subject) who go over all the wrecks throughout aviation history and the investigations and changes due to said crashes. 

The Newest Olympian: is the dude who did potterless but it's the Percy Jackson series instead, I've just recently gotten into it but it's a pretty solid listen if your curious about the books with a bit of humor in there too

Not another D&D podcast: they rival the early seasons of the adventure zone, I love there overall vibe as a group. 

We're alive: if you like zombie apocalypse radio drama type stuff or just zombies in general it's great! It's basically TWD in its heyday but with some left 4 dead type zombies tossed in. ( it's more in depth then that, I just don't wanna spoil it ) 

The edge of sleep: it's a radio drama with markiplier as the main character, he honestly does a solid job in a purely audio media. 

Wolf 359: it's a solid sc-if radio drama. Good mix of humor n seriousness and only gets better as it goes 

ars PARADOXICA: It's a intriguing take on time travel and my personal favorite! I re-listen to it about once or twice a year. 

Our fair city: it's finished now but it's a radio drama done up in the same humor as Monty python and it's a interesting take on a post apocalyptic world and rampant capitalism ramped up to 11. Serious worth a listen more then anything else on this list if it sounds up your ally. 

I got a few other D&D ones I listen to, they don't merit the list individually IMO but there all pretty solid if you like D&D- inglorious bards( pre twitch), the adventure zone, sneak attack,and join the party"
6360,"Bad Friends podcast is hilarious. Bobby Lee and Andrew Santinos. They rarely have guests. Every episode is entertaining. 

Theo Vons I particularly like the episodes when he gets just ordinary people on. Such as a plumber, arctic wildlife researcher, etc. 

If you like The Office. Office Ladies is good. 

Matthew Cox: Inside True Crime. He's a convicted felon for being a con artist, costing banks estimated 22 million. Through fraud with real estate. Somewhat recently got out after 12 years (time was cut in half). Most fascinating story, that you have to respect as a certain point.

If you're in to hip hop and hip hop culture, I am going to say maybe the most controversial thing here, the original Joe Budden Podcast was some of the most entertaining, hilarious things you can listen to.

It was 4 dudes just hanging out and cracking jokes on rappers and each other, with ties to these same rappers and people in the industry, so you might have Fab call in and they'll crack on him or you might have a video model call in and they'll crack on her.  When they broke up, it was never the same, but check it out.

Each show takes a deep dive into a terrible person in history (sometimes a movement or group of people) to detail their entire lives surrounding and including  the terrible acts that land them on the show.  It has added so much depth to my understanding of these people past ""this person bad because X"".  

Fair warning, they talk about some of the worst things human beings are capable of, but it isn't in gruesome detail and there is a lot of humor involved to lighten it up.  But if you or someone that may be listening has trauma from something they may need a trigger warning for, proceed with caution."

What makes this podcast great is his interviewing skills. This isn't like Adam Ruins Everything or The G Word. It's much more off the cuff. Basically, he has some expert come in to talk about a subject. Often, they've written a book he's clearly read, and it's a topic that he's not an expert in but isn't unfamiliar with. Which means that he's able to toe this line between giving a listener who knows nothing enough information to follow along, while also being able to ask the expert some fantastic questions that take the topic deeper. Plus, he's funny and he seems to bring out the funny in other people. Plus, I've listened to a couple where he didn't agree with an experts opinion and he didn't roll over on it. He questioned it, politely said he disagreed and backed up why. Definitely one of my go to's."

I'd recommend starting with the ""Amnesty"" arc which is about 31 episodes; a story set in modern day rural west virginia about monsters coming through portals and threatening the local community.

If you're into DnD their ""Balance"" campaign is fantastic being about 69 episodes long and is what really propelled them forward on this scene as its been spun off into cartoons and books.

If your life sucks and you feel like ending it all take a peak to this podcast and you will see what self inflicted misery really is and you will notice that your life is not that bad."
6546,"Fitness/Weightlifting related:

Data Driven Strength

Basically, every episode they take one (or a few) questions or hot topics in strength training, such as

""Does rep range really matter?""

""Is range of motion more important than weight?""

""Drops set? good or bad?

""A failure reps *the real ones that count*"" 

etc etc

Then they pull a bunch of studies and discuss them, from the background of their professional knowledge as scientific research professionals (and powerlifters/coaches)

The part that is great about their study reviews is that they don't just do

""ok so, someone did a study and it said THIS. That's the answer""

What they do is

Ok one available study that addresses this is HERE.

Before we start here's are some things we like about the methodologies in this study.

And here are some criticisms about this study or ways we wish the study would have been done different.

Ok but that said, here is what that study showed.

But keep in mind that is in this specific content.  Ok, no how that study apply to this question?  Better yet, how do these study results apply to the listers out there that care about this question. 

(Example they are always quick to call out when some study on some training protocol involved a pool of ""untrained subject"" i.e., non-athletes, when ""ok but the listeners of this show are mostly going to be people that have been in the gym for at least a few years so caveat emptor on that"")

Then they'll hit on :""ok now here is another study that has its own issues, but it kinda fills the gaps from the first study

and

""so end result, what's the bottom line for our listeners?  What practical decision would I make based on this information?""

and they are realistic about it.  Like, a very typical finding might be

>""ok so is there not-insignificant evidence that this training concept will get you more gains?  In size? not really.  In high percentage strength? Probably, SOME effect yes, though not a ton.  Would I recommend using this in your training?  Maybe but not a must. The data suggests there IS enough value in this that doing it is better than not doing it, if you are a lifter that is trying to optimize *every* training variable for peak results.  But the amount of training value is still going to be minor to just short of moderate. So *when you are deciding which levers to pull in your training* would I give up other things to fit this variable in? Would I override LIFESTYLE variables to fit this in? Probably not.*

(Example of the lifestyle variable put simply, if the data showed that training in the morning got better gains than training in the evening, great go for it.  But if switching to mornings meant interfering with sleep schedules, or work schedules, or hell you just don't like it, and that could affect your enthusiasm and motivation on a session to session basis, then nah the little bump of morning sessions isn't enough to worry about it)"

Criminal - a crime podcast for people who don't like crime podcasts. It's more of a crime adjacent, story telling/interview podcast. I find every episode interesting in part because of the variety of subject matter like diving for evidence in the LaBrea tar pits, life of a police dog, or identity theft of a child by a parent.

Articles of Interest - about clothing and fashion history and what it says about culture.

The Habitat - follows six volunteers secluded on a Hawaiian ""Mars Base"" as a study of what it would be like to live on Mars. Pretty cool personality studies.

Bundyville - The story of the Bundy family leading up to and after their takeover of federal land in Idaho (?)

Bundyville: The Remnant - white supremacy in the Pacific Northwest. Follow up to the above podcast with some widening of the subject matter.

American Scandal - various deep dives on historic American scandals (obviously). Great for learning about things you know of but not about. I started with the Oklahoma City bombing episodes which lead me into the Waco ones, but there's a wide variety."

Cautionary tales with Tim Harford: Each episode is about a different incident where something went very wrong, why it happened and what we can learn  from it. Everything from brigde collapses to disastrous inventions.

 The Deck - All based on people whi have appeared o  decks of cards used by law Enforcement to appeal for information on Mossi g person and unsolved murders. Very considerate kf the victims whilst the main aim is to get people to come forward with information to solve the crime. The Padcast presenters speak with the victims family and friends, Detectives and sometimes people of interest. 

Ear Hustle: Brilliant hosts present a podcast produced in a prison. The speak with prisoners, ex prisoners and guards. Very jnformatuve about life in prison and the realities of how people end up there.

Criminal: Each episode is a very well researched incident, started of as crimes but now is stories often with a big twist. My favourite is the episode about a homeowners last ditch attempt to stop fly tipping outside their Californian front yard with a Buddha which resulted in creating an entire community around the Buddha."

Off menu. Quite funny, unless it's the Nish Kumar episode then it's fucking hilarious. Trying to keep a straight face when it's on at work is difficult to hide.

Mean Book Club. They read bestsellers and review them, but definitely don't pull any punches. 

Scared to Death. Comedian Dan Cummins and his wife Lynsey share scary stories. Dan finds existing stories and legends, and Lynsey reads listener-submitted personal stories. 

Underunderstood. One of my absolute favorites, but this one is kind of hard to describe. The hosts try to find the answer to a question they've encountered that you can't just Google. Episodes include a saga where someone's luggage was lost at the airport while full of chili peppers, and they want to know if the chilis are safe to eat when they arrive after three weeks.

6922,"I'm listening to ""The Witch Trials of JK Rowling"" right now and it's incredibly interesting. A journalist was able to spend time with Rowling and get her to talk about everything from how she felt about Christians hating her books early on to the people who are angry at her about her trans statements now. However you feel about Rowling's stance on trans issues, if you enjoyed Harry Potter or are just fascinated by its place in pop culture, it's an incredibly interesting podcast."
6923,"You need to first ask yourself what do you want out of a podcast? Do you want to be entertained? Listen to any if the bajillion true crime podcasts. Do you want something ""funny"" on in the background that is mindless background noise that requires zero cognitive participation? You might be interested in Tiger Belly, literally any other comedians podcast. Do you want to learn something? There's a ton of great history podcasts like Revolution, or Stuff You Missed In History Class. Do you want to unlearn something and accelerate your mental decline? There's Joe Rogan for you. 

I don't listen to any of these because I have a very specific niche of podcast where I want to learn something but also be entertained and laugh. For that I recommend Behind the Bastards. It's very informative and quite funny. Their other podcast It Could Happen Here is also very good. Most of the guests are comedians or other podcast hosts who also have great podcasts. My last suggestion would be The Dollup, which also falls into this category."
6924,"Off Menu.  Two comedians interview a guest about their dream menu.  Guest dependant,  but some of them are just hysterical. 

You're Dead To Me.  Bite-sized history podcast about a historical figure.

Team Deakins.  The greatest living cinematographer interviews film people.  Great if you like modern cinema."
6925,Climbing Gold.. Alex Honolds podcast.. Im not even into climbing but hearing the stories about Yosemite are great. I highly recommend the dope lake series (I think its 4 podcasts). It starts a bit slow but its a good listen.

6928,"I'm a big fan of Secretly Incredibly Fascinating. 

I think Alex Schmidt is quirky and endearing, and his guests tend to be funny and interesting as well. It's a podcast where Alex researches a topic that we often take for granted and explains why it's secretly fascinating. 

I think Behind the Bastards and Daily Zeitgeist are great quality, but the negativity of the world weighs on me and I've had to cut both from my media diet. SIF remains because I like to take a walk and listen to something about how the world is more interesting than we might think it is."

LTT WAN Show (partly for the tech, partly for AI updates, and mostly for Dan Luke and Linus)

6932,2 be better- great pod about relationships and general life advice. They are teaching me the things I should have gotten from my parents but never got as part of a broken household
6933,The Magnus Archives. A horror story to keep you wide awake during those long car rides.
6934,"I still listen to Welcome to Night Vale

Jeffrey Cranor and Cecil Baldwin from Night Vale also have a horror movie podcast, which started as Cecil introducing Jeffrey to the genre, but after two years has mostly become two seasoned horror buffs analyzing and comparing movies.  The podcast is called Random Number Generator Horror Podcast No. 9, and their gimmick is they roll dice to determine the type of monster and style of film each week.

LeVar Burton Reads is also nice.  Burton reads a short fiction story each episode, then gives some brief thoughts on his impressions."
6935,"Chilluminati podcast is always a great laugh.  
3 guys talk about everything from the paranormal, to true crime.  
Mathis is the believer  
Alex is the maybeliever 
Jesse believes in none of it.  

I HIGHLY recommend the Mothman episodes."
6936,"If you're going to be a dad, are a dad, are a guy, or just want to learn more about being a dad, check out Dear Old Dads which is a podcast about ""examining and deconstructing all things Dad. From parenting to patriarchy; manning the grill to manning up; Dear Old Dads asks - what even is a dad anyway? What does it mean to be a good man in today's world? What should it mean?"" And the hosts are hilarious."
6937,"""Where Did the Road Go?"".


Even though I don't believe in it, I'm fascinated by the ""paranormal"" or ""high strangeness"", but I dislike that many shows covering the topic are right leaning because they're on AM radio..

""Where Did the Road Go?"" Is the exception, Seriah is a really chill metal fan that talks about strange topics and the podcast feels like you're eavesdropping on a group of friends talking about it as opposed to a show.

It's easy to find on YouTube."

It runs using a homemade system that has been full developed and tested over many many years, with plenty of occult, espionage, suspense, horror, and some humor.  The show is very well produced with an intricate and fulfilling story, I can't recommend it enough."
6947,"**Busted Business Bureau**  \[[Website](https://www.bustedbizbureau.com/)\]

A research-based comedy podcast on white collar true crime hosted by Chicago comic, Christian Borkey,  who dissects (and vivisects) various businesses' scandals with fantastic guests.  Favorite episodes (about an hour each) I'd recommend are [Six Flags](https://www.bustedbizbureau.com/six-flags-a-chaotic-retrospective/) or the [NHL: A Greek tragedy in three acts](https://www.bustedbizbureau.com/the-nhl-a-greek-tragedy-in-three-acts/) ; there's also a whole season on [Monsanto](https://www.bustedbizbureau.com/monsanto/) which is W I L D.

6955,"Norse Mythology: The unofficial Guide

It does very much what you'd expect it to do: telling you Norse mythological stories. But then it goes on tangents into linguistic and cultural details that will stick with you longer than the tales."

6960,"My favorite is the Fire Escape Cast. 

It's nominally about games, but it's really about three close friends (Dan Ryckert from Giant Bomb, Mary Kish from Twitch, and Mike Mahardy from Polygon) riffing on each other. It's always funny, easily more entertaining that some shows that are explicitly marketed as comedy."

6963,"If you're the kinda person who enjoyed sharing ghost stories around a fire at Summer camp, you might like ""The Magnus Archives""."
6964,"A couple months ago I would have said Opening Arguments as a fantastic legal/politics show. They released twice a week and covered anything from obscure copyright law to Supreme Court decisions, election law, with a recent emphasis on Trump and Jan 6th related crimes.

The best episodes were ""deep dives"" that the lawyer host would spend 45 min to an hour dissecting a legal claim or judicial ruling. Over the 4ish years I listened my understanding of courts/legal documents and the judiciary massively improved. 

Unfortunately there was *massive* drama that has resulted in lawsuits and an alleged takeover of the podcast. What remains is a shadow of its former self. That being said there is a catalog of some 600 or so mostly excellent episodes. If there was an interesting legal issue in the past 6 years they probably covered it. 

Another favorite was a short series called Behind the Police, sort of a mini series addition to Behind the Bastards. I find BtB a bit much and don't listen to it, but BtP was great. It was a 6 part series examining the history of policing in the US, and how we (unique amongst Western democracies) have such a violent police force. US police will kill more people in 1 year than *all* police forces in Europe + Canada/AUS/NZ will do in decades. One interesting nugget I learned was that much of the police in the south had their origins as slave catchers/bounty hunters and there is a direct through line to their attitudes towards minorities in the present time."
6965,"Casefile is the best true crime podcast I've found. Worldwide stories, not just famous ones.

Jim Jefferies ""I don't know about that"" is hysterical and actually teaches you stuff"
6966,"This Podcast Will Kill You - a delve into a bunch of diseases. They go through the symptoms, the biology, the history, and current treatments... You often find out the diseases are a lot worse than you originally thought, the way the infect you is oddly specific or unique from what you were taught in school, and that there is little hope for curing some of them."
6967,"Do Go On. 

Every week one of the three hosts comes back with a report on a voted on topic. Ranging from shipwrecks, heists, murders, mysteries, biographies etc. I know that's not unique or special and I think in a weaker podcast, it would just boil down to one person reciting a wiki article. But the hosts have such good chemistry and are so funny, that they carry it so well, making any topic engaging or hilarious."
6968,"Going out on a limb....

But I do listen to The Joe Rogan Podcast religiously.

Not that I agree with everything that is said and done on it... but the people he has on are so f*cking interesting. They're experts st the stuff they do and know and it's very mind opening sometimes to learn some new stuff. 

Great times when he has the other comedians on as well. 

I know he has had some ""issues"" in the past... but everyone else does too right? If you're not as political as he is, just take ot with a grain of salt snd listen to the conversations they have. Sometimes it can be very informational...."
6969,"Mobituaries with Mo Rocca

I really like most anything he does on CBS News Sunday Morning.  He's quirky fun and the topics and information are wonderfully produced.  They are the right length for my walk, too (about 45 min).  Arcs like a TV episode.

The topics are lesser known dead people, or sometimes inanimate objects, and their life story (like an elongated obituary, of course).  Some real life people include Anna Mae Wong and Chang and Eng Bunker (famous conjoined twins).  Some other topics include death of the Station Wagon or the Gros Michel Banana."

7006,"My favorites are

Podcast but outside- 2 comedians on the street interviewing strangers who walk by

Smartless- A more generic podcast with a different celebrity guest each week, hosted by actors Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes, and Will Arnett

Working it out- If you care about comedy and what goes into it this is a great one, each week is a different comedian and they usually discuss and work out unfinished jokes, hosted by comedian Mike Birbiglia

These are less educational than some of the other suggestions and the latter two mostly only pertain to people who care about the entertainment industry, but i think they are fun/interesting listens."
7007,"Even though it's the only one podcast I actively listen to, I heavily recommend the Trash Taste Podcast. First it introduces us as an anime podcast, but then it quickly turns around into just a podcast made by 3 dudes who just happened to be weebs with anime just tackled very rarely. With 3 personalities that either bond all together or just one person being either the normal person or the weird one."

They end each episode with an update on where the disease/virus/etc stands today and if it has been eradicated or if a cure is available or in the works.

7047,"I'd recommend Blowback which is sort of a history of US imperialism in the 20th/21st century. The first season about the initial 2003 invasion of Iraq was a real stunner especially since so much about the early days of that war has been memory holed. I was a child when the Iraq War went down so I never knew too much about the details of the conflict before checking out Blowback. It admittedly has something of a left leaning slant, but the historical analysis is well grounded so I think non-leftists can enjoy it as well."

Sawbones: Great Medical history podcast. Hosts include Dr. Sydney Mcelroy and her husband whonknows about cereal and video games. Family friendly, informative, great laughs.

Wolf 359: sci-fi show that will have you laughing and crying as you follow Coms officer Doug Eiffel as he begrudingly floats around the start wolf 359 and shenanagins ensue. Completed a while ago so you can binge and listen to one of the finest audio dramas ever made.

Old Gods of Appalachia: a horror anthology podcast that follows various characters in Appalachian America. Sound design and stories are insane and the things that go bump in the night may be the least if your worries. Ongoing and touring with live shiws in select locations."

7064,"It really depends on your tastes man. If you like stand up comedy and movies then the ""We Might Be Drunk"" podcast by Mark Normand and Sam Morril is great. If you arent a fan it'll probably get pretty boring and you wouldn't recognize or care about 99% of their guests."
7065,"One of my all time favorites is ""*The Ongoing History of New Music*"" by Alan Cross. They are easy little 20-30 minute episodes about damn near everything to happen in music from the early 1900's till now. For anyone looking to get into it the 15 part *History of Alt Rock* series he does is one of my favorites. 

Another good music podcast is ""*Song Exploder*"" where an artist will break down one of their songs from concept to completion. Also shorter easy to listen episodes. I would recommend Metallica, Mumford & Sons, Maggie Rogers, Mobb Deep, and The Lumineers.

If there are any snowboarders in here ""*The Bomb Hole*"" is another classic."

Almost every story should come with a trigger warning.  But there are many many stories that have stuck with me.  Stories I can't unhear.  The one about the Toronto paramedic dealing with a guy , a razor, and what he has done using the razor.  Or the absolutely harrowing account of a violent schizophrenic woman almost killing her mother.   Not for the faint of heart, but very addictive and often revelatory."

Netlore is a very good podcast if you are terminally online like I am, I recommend them because they need more listeners.

The Biggest Problem In The Universe is fucking hilarious, though the ending of the podcast was a giant disaster.

The Adventure Zone Balance is the only good DnD podcast I have ever listened to (Critical Roll is not that good, I don't care what anyone says). Don't listen to anything after Balance, TAZ Graduation is the worst thing I've ever listened to and it made me quit listening to any McElroy thing that has Travis and made me seriously dislike Justin (though I can still stomach him)."

7142,"For (U.S.) current events & politics, The Lost Debate is an excellent  podcast that takes unbiased views from all sides, and keeps you informed and gives a good base to form opinions. I'd recommend it highly

For true crime that is victim centric, and thoroughly researched, I recommend the CaseFile podcast and Crime Junkies (and the crime junkies satellite podcasts)

Horror/fiction, in case true crime is too much for you - Tower Four and Paralyzed are two excellently written and acted podcasts from Seven Lamb productions, check their stuff out 

For US history, I cannot recommend History that Doesn't Suck - it's super interesting, and incredibly accurate. They tell history in a really digestible and fun way. Also check out 1865 for a dramatized, extremely well done & acted depiction of Lincoln's assassination and it's aftermath

For background chatter, something light, or even something to fall asleep too, I'd recommend NPR's Car Talk, which they've been uploading in podcast form. Click & Clack are treasures, super smart, helpful, and of course hilarious. A timeless classic, wether you are interested in cars or not.

For interesting interviews and self improvement, the Jordan Harbinger show is excellent. Tons of variety and topics, some truly interesting guests

The Scottish History Podcast is self explanatory, very well done, I highly recommend it. Made my trip to Scotland so much more informed and interesting! 

For a fictional ""movie"" style podcast with a single episode, Shipworm is great. Suspenseful, dark, with excellent acting and sound effects. 


I listen to 40 hours a week of podcasts at work, so I've been through a few shows! 

Honorable mentions:

7150,"If you like comedy podcasts and are a young adult demographic, then The Yard is actually worth watching, desirable backlog and also didn't age to become just a mess of inside jokes like most other comedy podcasts."
7151,"I see the Mike Duncan podcast collection is well-known by this group, so I'll recommend ""Fall of Civilizations"" in a similar vein. Great narration with sound effects to give the stories a real sense of place. Not to mention they incorporate readings in ancient languages, along with musical selections from the past, to make the history even more tangible. 


""Black Cowboys"" is also an excellent look at American history from a much too often overlooked and ignored perspective. The host's conversations with his father are my favorite part of the episodes.


For more pop culture than history, I love ""60 Songs That Explain the 90s."" Deep dive into 90s music from across genres, with lots of context tying the music to other social trends of the decade."

It's a show that goes in-depth on far-right conspiracy theories. I'm so glad I found it 'cause it's a horribly fascinating topic and a lot of real people really believe that stuff.

- Casefile (Super well written and narrated True Crime srories)

Jordan's show is most diverse and I've already learned a ton of interesting things while also having quite some laughs along the way"
7167,"Meaningful Money

It's a UK based finance podcast.  But the host keeps it light and relevant and above all, not dry and about numbers.  

Each season deals with a different financial aspect in detail but he lays down simple ideas and rules that you can adopt to get your money situation on track no matter what your situation.

Yes it's based around UK tax rules etc but the ideas behind it covert to the country or economy of your choice."
7168,"Otherworld is a fantastic paranormal podcast of real people giving their account of strange things that happened to them, filtered and framed by the host. Really interesting stuff, and I would say especially worth a listen if you are the type to not believe in any of that kind of stuff."
7169,"If you're into film and/or history, **You Must Remember This** is excellent. Karina does extensive research and covers a huge variety of film stars and Hollywood scandals all the way from the silent era through the 1990s.

Other entertaining history podcasts are: Ridiculous History, Lore, Grim & Mild, Stuff You Missed in History Class, and The Bowery Boys.

You get access to a ton of deep dives on personality disorders and a ton of other stuff. Highly recommend!
7174,History of the 20th Century. It's by Mark Painter and moves chronologically through the 20th century. There's plenty of focus on major events but also on pop culture. I also think he does an excellent job getting as much of a whole world perspective as possible instead of just a western view. The first few dozen episodes have mediocre audio quality but it improves as the show goes on. Currently on episode 319 around the early days of WW2.

Hrishikesh Hirway works through a huge catalog of songs, detailing how they were made, what kinds of choices the artists made (often with the artist included as an interviewee), and how/why they received whatever level of acclaim they did.  It often makes me really appreciate music that I'd never have known or liked otherwise, and it also goes deep into tracks I've always loved, giving me new layers to enjoy when I hear them.  Awesome stuff."

Started listening during the pandemic and have never regretted it. They release daily podcasts. Mainly on current events but will also do some interesting takes on cultural topics etc. It's really well edited and just an easy listening, each episode being between 30 mins to an hour.

7284,"Past Gas by Donut Media. It's an automotive history podcast, and I know that doesn't sound too interesting at first, but I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. I would suggest listening to it from the beginning. Most of the episodes are their own story, but the first 4 all tell the story of Ford vs. Ferrari at LeMans in 1966. The show covers a ton of topics and people that I had never heard of before, and it's really interesting. 

Another good one is Distractible. It's just Markiplier, Bob, and Wade being hilarious. My favorite episode is ""Bob's Fridge"", one of the first episodes."

I haven't seen a podcast make that much content/ interact with their fans as much as they do. One day I'm hoping to join their Patreon because some of their rewards are fantastic.

7480,"It really really depends on what you are looking for. There a a ton of shitty podcasts out there but there are also a lot that are really good. 

I don't know what you like but here are a bunch of my favorites:

Politics and news: 

- The Daily. It's a news podcast by The New York Times.

- The Journal. News podcast by The Wall Street Journal. 

History: 

- Dan Carlin's Hardcore History. Especially ""Blueprint for Armageddon"" about world war 1. It's long format so many episodes are 2-3 hours long. The host is not a historian so if you are looking for absolute accuracy and academic level history this is not the right one. But he is an amazing story teller. 

- Age of Napoleon. A podcast series about, well Napoleon, but also the French Revolution and European politics and warfare in the 1700s. 

- Noble Blood. This details the lives and (often bloody) deaths of a long list of historical figures. 

Scary stuff: 

- Scared to death. Not for everybody but I like it. Comedian Dan Cummins and his wife Lindsay tell each other spooky stories.

Pop culture and just passing time: 

- Conan O'Brien needs a friend. Obviously you'd have to like Conan O'Brien to like this podcast but if you do it's great. Just him and his producer and assistant talking to different celebrities. The interviews definitely come off as more real and honest (and hilarious) than traditional talk show interviews. 

- This is Love. This is one of my favorites. Just the host, Phoebe Judge (who I adore) telling different stories about love - in more than the romantic sense. Latest episode is about two golden retrievers. 

Science:

- Ologies with Alie Ward. This is a pop science podcast. The concept is that in every episode the host, Alie Ward, interviews an expert in some sort of ""-ology"", hence the name. It's fun, at times silly, but always interesting. 

- This podcast will kill you. The two hosts, both named Erin, who are grad students in epidemiology, talk about the history and biology of different diseases. 

True Crime:

- Up against the Mob. The host is a former prosecutor and tells the story about prosecuting a mafia family.

- Crooked City: Youngstown, OH. This podcast is about corruption and the Mafia (I really like mob stuff) in Youngstown, OH. 

- Criminal. This podcast has the same host as This is Love. I really like Phoebe Judge, I find her voice so soothing. This is about different stories of crimes of all varieties. I find that many true crime podcasts revel too much in the gore and bloody details which I really find off putting. This does not do that."

7491,"I've been listening to Animorphs Anonymous, I enjoyed the books back in the day, but I hadn't thought about them much for 20 years.

Their father used to be a Radio Host, and they all seem to have some experience in either theatre, or similar stuff via schooling.



They also do a rpg podcast with their dad called The Adventure Zone. (It's mostly been dnd, but they do other systems too.

There are many history podcasts that are getting mentioned here that are truly fantastic, so I second all those.

For fiction, which I have been vibing with as of late, Old Gods of Appalachia is amazing, and ongoing. I can't recommend it highly enough. 
The Black Tapes is also really good so far (I'm in season 2 of 3), but it seems they've been on hiatus for nearly six years. It's been worth it so far, but that's a personal choice lol.

For nonfiction, Secret Societies is fascinating! Very well produced, and lots of cool information.

The Man Enough Podcast explores what it means to be a man today and how rigid gender roles have affected all people. The show creates a safe environment for a range of perspectives to meet and stay at the table, exploring how the messages of masculinity show up in relationships, body image, privilege, fatherhood, sex, success, mental health and so much more. Instead of polarizing and demonizing men and masculinity, it invites all humans to participate and thrive in the world."

7814,"I really enjoy listening to podcasts in bed, kinda like being read a bedtime story. I don't like ones with lots of ads, especially when they aren't voiced by the podcasters themselves as the audio can be loud and jarring. I also don't like ones with more than two speakers, or ones with lots of laughing frequently for the same reason. Here's some of my faves:

Noble Blood: probably my all time favourite. Dana Schwartz has a calming voice, and the historical stories are often ones I haven't heard of before. The tragic lives of nobles throughout history, told through an accurate and critical lens. 

Myths and Legends: they have started doing more ads lately, but they are read by the casters. Fun twists on familiar and not so familiar stories. Fictional and Scoundrels by them are great too. 

Philosophize This: I'm doing my master's in philosophy and this is easily the best philosophy podcast out there. This one is my partners favourite because Stephen West has a calming voice and there are no ads. He does not share my enjoyment of bedtime podcasts so I try to pick ones he doesn't mind. 

You're Wrong About: it's changed a bit since Michael Hobbes left, but it's still a great podcast. Lots of interesting stories, including ones I have in fact been wrong about. The Kitty Genovese one was especially eye opening. 

If Books Could Kill: another one my partner enjoys. Very interesting and entertaining. Breaking down bad non-fiction books that somehow gain popularity."

7973,"There's a Brazilian podcast called Human Project: Evandro's Case, made by Ivan Mizanzuk. It even have become a series. You can watch it at Globo Play Streaming. 

In the 90's in Brazil, a lot of kids were been kidnapped. One day, Evandro was kidnap in a small city. Days after, the police arrests seven people, between them the wife and daughter of the mayor of the city. The police records a tape with confessions of this seven people saying they have sacrificed Evandro in a dark magic ritual. After the prisons, the seven people says they were tortured to confess. 

 Why it's great: Ivan doesn't just analize the case, but how the Brazilian society was in the 90's. Corruption, torture, the beginning of democracy just after the end of our dictatorship, satanic panic, media, prejudice against religions, specially African religions, politics, justice, etc. 

SPOILER DON'T READ IF YOU WANT TO HEAR/WATCH 
Ivan's research was so great that he have found evidences that the seven were really tortured and I think two years ago, they were declared not guilty. Some of the seven died on the prison, but some got free after this new evidence. He have found this evidences after 3 years of the beginning of the podcast. A lot of characters from this history are still alive.

8037,"I've got a few, all of which a comedy ones if that tickles your fancy. 

Chatabix- Joe Wilkinson and David Earl. It's really good chat, and it doesn't try too hard, it's really light hearted and easy to listen to. 

Wolf and Owl- Romesh Ranganathan and Tom Davis. Sort of similar to Chatabix, but with more life insight, they try and help sort people's problems from their own experiences and usually leads on winding anecdotes that you never know where they will end up. 

Hardcore Listing- an obscure podcast about Top 5s. From Top 5 things about Basildon to Top 5 Nic Cage Freakouts. Very very funny stuff 

Off Menu- James Acaster and Ed Gamble. A great podcast about food. Hearing a new guest each week enter the dream restaurant and outline their dream meals. A particular highlight I would recommend would be Reece Shearsmith's episode, very very funny! 

What's Upset You Now?- Paul McCaffrey and Seann Walsh. A bite size podcast with two blokes moaning at the world. From ever increasing prices to strange interactions. Each episode is only 15 minutes at a time! Very very good stuff! 

Very UK heavy, but all are very good! Hope you enjoy them!"

8166,"NADDPOD, it's a D&D podcast comprised of some College Humor alums and 2 people are in active games on Dimension 20. They are funny, but their game is amazing improv storytelling. Legitimately, you will really empathize with their characters, and their goofs become such an amazing inside joke. When not playing D&D, they have, during their first campaign, random ""talk show"" episodes hosted by an NPC in the game. Later on, they spend their off-game episodes with a show called Dungeon Court, where they field listener ""cases"" and enact ""rulings"" on them. They also host a ""book club"" show, where they review books based on video games and such. Their Patreon episodes, Short Rest, which they record immediately after each episode of actual play D&D, are amazing as well. 

Even if you aren't a D&D player but enjoy a fun story with solid character development that can range from light hearted to very dark, this podcast is for you."

8172,I'm late but I love Our Fake History
8173,"not a big podcaster but picky about what I listen to so here's my few choice picks.

Bad Friends: If you're looking for a little out of pocket comedy Bobby Lee and Andrew Santino always make me laugh. 

Sinisterhood: They cover everything from paranormal to true crime and they do a ton of research before their podcast. They deviate from the topic sometimes but they are a funny duo and deliver the stories in an interesting way that isn't too distracting for a little background podcast.

Sasquatch Chronicles: This ones kind of an odd ball but at-least for me I love hearing these peoples personal stories and theories and the host has a very enjoyable voice imo. Driving through the woods at night or backroads in the mountains this is my go to even if you don't believe in Bigfoot which to be honest I don't it's just interesting to listen to their stories and wonder what really happened to them that day. 

There's a few more I like but these are my main three"
8174,"Uncanny Japan is pretty interesting, as well as Lore."
8175,"Timesuck by comedian Dan Cummins.

Educational podcast with a dark humor spin. Serial killers to cults to historical figures to random subjects."
8176,"Depends on what you're looking for. 

Shameless- pop culture podcast for smart people who love dumb stuff. Pop culture is my guilty pleasure and these Australian hosts give a pretty solid take on the goings on. Actual journalists and give some solid discussions. They disagree like adults and they feel like your best friends. They also give great recs for other media. 

Man enough- deep discussions between two men and a woman with a guest host. Dissect what it means to ""be a man"". I think Alok Vaid-Menon's episode should be required for all to hear. But this has honestly changed my brain chemistry and how I view certain topics. My SO and best friend have also started listening to this. 

Honeydew Me- two ladies new to the sex game have ""sexpert"" guests on and ask them ALL of the questions. It's kink and fetish shame free and they have honeydew lists of homework where they try a couple of different things and discuss the good, the bad, and if they'll be trying it again. 

Against the Odds- people telling their stories about surviving against the odds. 

Highschool Sucked- but only the episodes where Darcy is still the original co-host. After that it's so far out of left field. Essentially interviewing (mostly Canadian) well known people and celebrities and discussing how they grew up and their high school experiences. 

Father Knows Something- dad that responds to write ins with his daughter and her boyfriend asking for advice in life situations. He usually gives some pretty solid advice. His daughter has her own podcast (hers was first and then he guest hosted and people liked him so much they did a spin off type thing) called Two Hot Takes. 

F1R The Girls- F1 racing podcast hosted by women. My SO is really into F1 and we both really enjoy the Netflix docuseries on the sport. Listening to this helps me understand and doesn't feel like they talk down to me when they explain things. 

I'll be gone in the dark- the most original true crime podcast. This is done by Michelle McNamara (Patton oswalts deceased wife) about the golden state killer.

Edit. Adding a rec that I just started today and I'm laughing out loud. I have never laughed out loud so much for a podcast. Toni and Ryan. Freaking hilarious."

It's a must see from the beginning of the show, to witness the evolution of the Dudesy AI to create increasingly complex segments, and it starts making moves outside the podcast studio.

It's great journalism and storytelling and I couldn't recommend it enough.

8384,"[The Overnightscape](https://archive.org/details/onsugradio) is the best podcast that I've ever listened to and is also arguably one of the first podcasts ever, if not the first. I only discovered it in 2021 while searching for live Hall & Oates concerts on archive.org and the results brought up random episodes. For whatever reason I didn't listen to any of those episodes and instead decided to start from the very beginning and fell down the rabbit hole of an incredible audio adventure that Frank Edward Nora started in 2003 and has continued to make to this day. So far I am up to episode 603/2003 in my journey but I've never heard anything like it and I honestly wish I could have discovered it sooner."

I also got to learn a lot about the different Vedic Schools and Afro-Futurism! The host's specialty is the Islamic Golden Age!

If you like history, I'd recommend it 1000%. It goes over the stories of nobility throughout history, and really it's telling stories about people. It's so interesting. They also do their research incredibly well, and try to present both the story that's always been told about certain things, while presenting the actual truth as we know it. I've learned about so many interesting things. Royals with glass delusion, the guy who tried to declare himself emperor of America, Lord Byron's insane antics, the prince of Korea in the rice box, etc. Rather than dry history it's all the good parts. Also episodes are usually around 20-40 minutes, much more reasonable than some podcasts."

8688,"God absolutely amazing podcast, but it's a big shame he wasn't in his groove yet in the first 10 episodes, I would've loved to hear the early/mythical history of Rome covered in the same depth and quality as the show got once it hit Augustus and later"
8689,' Fall of civilisations' has about 20 really well done several hrs docos that are awesome and also an ongoing podcast. My favourite ancient history channel by far.
8690,"History of Rome is very good.

Revolutions is EXCELLENT. 

History of Byzantium by Robin Pierson tries to pick up where Mike Duncan's HoR left off and does a nice job. 

And of course Hardcore History by Dan Carlin is fantastically entertaining and interesting as well.  With the understanding the Mike Duncan approaches is more history teacher and Carlin is more ""pop history"". Carlin does a good job, but he sidetracks into his own thoughts here and there."
8691,Byzantine History podcast picks up right where Duncan left off and intentionally tries to mirror his style. Also very good.
8692,I'm still happy that he narrated The Storm Before the Storm and even had the HoR intro music at the beginning of the recording
8693,"This is the podcast that got me into podcasts, it also got me into Rome, Far East History, American history, etc.

This podcast should be stored in a vault and made sure never to disappear."
8694,Currently on my second listen through. I just wanted to listen to the first couple of episodes again to remind myself how the Romans are possibly the descendants of the defeated Trojans. Now I'm up to the formation of the first triumvirate and I'm fully engaged again.
8695,where can I find it?
8696,Is it really a podcast if the sound isn't weird the first few episodes?
8697,There's a History of Byzantium which picks up where this podcast leaves off. Highly recommend it
8698,I bet that podcast wasn't built in a day.
8699,First podcast I ever listened to. Nearly ruined all others for me afterwards since his had set the bar so incredibly high
8700,"If you enjoy Mike Duncan's stuff you might want to listen to [The Space Above Us](http://thespaceabove.us). I make the show and explicitly modeled after ""what if Mike Duncan did a spaceflight history podcast?"" 170+ episodes and counting, covering Project Mercury, the X-15, Project Gemini, the Apollo Program, Skylab, the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, and the Space Shuttle, including a big section on Shuttle-Mir that I'm just now wrapping up."

8703,"Bro, I actually just finished that whole podcast. I'm actually disappointed now that it's over. It was the best thing to listen to at work where no one was bothered by it. I'm thinking of just listening to it all over again because I'm pretty sure I zoned out on a few episodes because I was at work."
8704,"Emperors of Rome (La Trobe University AU)

Hundreds of episodes, Dr Rhiannon Evans is amazing well versed and never says 'um.'  Live episodes and guest speaker are not so enjoyable though."
8705,"If you like history, listen to the British history podcast. It's a granular telling of the story of Great Britain from the time of the last ice age and up until the Norman invasion (1066~), and still going strong. It is my absolute favourite podcast, no contest. It's all 100% free, no annoying ads or breaks, just a short reminder of the benefits of subscribing at the start of each episode. 400+ episodes and counting. Over 100 members only episodes. Membership is something like 50 bucks per year I think, totally worth it imo.

8707,"I got really into revolutions and remember thinking at one point. Damn. I have a degree in political science and I'm learning so much more from this podcast. Maybe I should have taken more history classes too.

Then I remembered I took a ton of history classes and this podcast is just better than those were."
8708,">History of Rome.

Thanks for putting this back on my radar. I heard a few of the initial episodes a few years back, looking forward to getting back in, especially given the glowing reviews."
8709,"I wish I could get into this, and Revolutions. But for some reason, the audio quality and production is just so grating to me. I can't focus on the content at all. 

Wondering if there's a better jumping in point than episode 1 (for either History of Rome or any season of Revolutions)? Anyone else have this problem who were able to overcome it?"

8717,My husband has been listening to these for years! Apparently he does group trips aswell and will walk around discussing the history of places. It's his dream to go to one. First time I have ever seen this podcast brought up but happy to!
8718,This is one of my favorite experiences
8719,This is the way
8720,I think I'm on my 7th or 8th listen through in the last few years. It has sparked so many things in me and I cannot recommend it enough!

8729,I've listened to this podcast all the way through probably 10 times now. It's great for falling asleep to. That's not a diss. It's only boring if you are not interested in the subject. I love it!
8730,Great when someone genuinely loves what they're talking about AND are knowledgeable. You can tell he does his homework.

Heard from a mutual friend he had started podcasting and figured I'd give it a listen. Probably one of the most interesting and funny podcasts out there and I don't even know much about engineering. A little surprised that this was the top of the thread but I absolutely agree that it's a podcast worth listening to!"

Like, I've spent my career as a writer and researcher in the publishing world. Learning pointless information is what I do for a living, but I still find myself shaking my head in amazement at an obscure historical figure whose name she can pull off the top of her head."

8763,From Philly? I'm sold.
8764,Their bonus episode on Protestantism is an all-time banger.

8766,"And if you enjoy this podcast, and want to hear Alice talking about startups, check out Trashfuture"
8767,"Lol! Liam studied economics, not engineering. Alice studied law."
8768,"I really wanted to like this, as the material is right up my alley. But the format is unbearable. It feels like you're sitting next to a group of obnoxious friends, each trying to outdo the other with snarky jokes and sarcasm, waffling on about everything but the subject for the first 20 minutes. Like one big inside joke you're not a part of."
8769,"""But first, the goddam news"""
8770,Yay Liam.
8771,Lions Led by Donkeys is another favorite of mine. Military history from a leftist perspective mostly focused on terrible leadership decisions. Same producer and Liam was a cohost for a long while until the host moved to Armenia.

8776,Will give it a try
8777,"> Great podcast, I went to school with Justin and he was always a very funny guy with his dry sense of humor. Heard from a mutual friend he had started podcasting and figured I'd give it a listen. Probably one of the most interesting and funny podcasts out there and I don't even know much about engineering. A little surprised that this was the top of the thread but I absolutely agree that it's a podcast worth listening to!

Do you have to watch the slides to enjoy it? What I like about podcasts is that I can listen while doing other things (such as driving or the dishes or whatever), and that's kind of pointless of you have to watch slides to follow along."
8778,"> Well There's Your Problem: A podcast about engineering disasters. With Slides. 

How do you listen to a podcast with slides?"
8779,"At the risk of sounding overly dramatic, this comment is life-changing for me. 

I work in the field of engineering disasters. Working on projects like this is one of the reasons I get out of bed in the morning. I have been hunting for content of this nature for years. I have curated a list of videos, podcasts, etc. that are mostly trash. It is difficult to find good content with a strong technical component. Creators don't want to risk boring their audience. But I am exactly that audience and refuse to be bored by it!

I pay literal money to attend seminars discussing structural engineering disasters. Nothing advances my field quite like structural failure and collapse, at least not with the same urgency."
8780,"Yay Liam!

&#x200B;

I hope that anyone that disagrees with this comment has a nice time."
8781,way too irritating to listen to. pass
8782,"I was excited to listen to this but after forty minutes it's a nope from me. Too much edge based posturing and not enough content, I think a large part of Reddit would enjoy it though."
8783,"so happy to see this at the tippety-top of the thread, came here to recommend this!!"
8784,"I was so delighted to see this as the top comment, and I cannot agree more.  It's EXCELLENT."

8787,You might also enjoy TRASHFUTURE which Alice is also on
8788,"Shagged married annoyed, will on occasion make me laugh"
8789,"Yay Liam

Also Lions Led by Donkeys is a good podcast in the WTYP sphere."
8790,I gave it a try yesterday evening based on your recommendation and it's great and hilarious and exactly my taste. Thank you very much!
8791,I don't like horror and I love this podcast - they do a great job of interpreting Appalachian/rural southern culture while bringing in some real diversity in their storytelling.
8792,"Oh, hell yes! I discovered this one last month and binged it in a week. I *need* new episodes."
8793,"OGoA is one of my all-time favorite things, period."
8794,Scrolled to far for this one. The ambiance of the stories is excellent as are the characters and world building and stories. I usually stick to nonfiction informative podcasts but this show is the big exception.
8795,It's great! Just saw their live show last week
8796,I often find myself working in the pre-dawn hours and this podcast is really fitting for the setting. Nothing like being near the woods and hearing stories of things that normal mortals were not meant to see.
8797,YES. ABSOLUTELY YES. 
8798,I've learnt a lot about moss.
8799,"My favorite thing about it is normally funny podcasts need to take time to build up to a punchline, climax, or twist. So there's often lots of exposition to set things up. No Such Thing as a Fish has educational, fascinating fun facts for its build up to funny moments/punchlines. So it's saturated with worthwhile content from start to finish. The stuff in between the laughs isn't just setups. It's really interesting stuff!"
8800,This is one of the first podcasts I've recommended for years. Seen them live too. Great show
8801,"One of my favourites.

""Podcast of Unnecessary Detail"" is similar but they go more in depth about each topic. Same great British humour."
8802,"In a similar vein (comedy + educational):  
- The infinit monkey cage  
- The curious cases of Rutherford and Fry  
- A podcast of unnecessary detail  
- A problem squared  

They are all a little different, but worth a listen when you run out of Fish episodes

Fish does seem to hit the best balance, though. It's a relentless torrent of both jokes and facts."
8803,Thank you! QI is one of my favorite shows and I totally forgot about their research division having a podcast.
8804,I miss Anna
8805,It's a fantastic listen while eating a panino
8806,"This gave me one of my biggest laughing whilst driving experiences- they were talking about a music teacher/composer who had sex with his student on their second lesson or something

Then one of them goes with total deadpan 'that's quick...you normally only work on fingering in the first few lessons' it was just the perfect pun"
8807,Worth noting there are several hundred eps of this series - so lots and lots and lots of hours of listening if you're looking for a podcast to really dive into
8808,"Adding ""Completely Arbortrary"" to the funny & educational vein

It's all about trees and how completely awesome they are

Also Ologies is a great science podcast to checkout"
8809,"I came here for this, it's one of the few I listen to religiously."
8810,I tried to get into it after My Dad Wrote A Porno (listened to an episode or two) any recs on good entry episodes?
8811,Came here to say this. I am incapable of pronouncing Covent Garden properly anymore.
8812,This is my wife's current favorite. Good series for remaining light hearted while learning about a topic. Sometimes you need something that is not a murder or disaster.
8813,Yes
8814,"I love it so much, however the damn theme tune is god awful."
8815,I'm really pleased that this is so near the top. Best podcast out there.
8816,Was going to comment this glad it's so high up
8817,"I wonder how Anna is faring with the whole ""no drinking while pregnant"" thing."
8818,Was coming here to say this exact show. It's so good and has over 400 episodes of fun and interesting facts. I'm almost caught up though. Not sure what I'll do when I catch up and don't have the next episode to go to.
8819,"I've listened to all of them now, and have switched it to my bedtime podcast.  I used to listen to Stuff You Should Know to fall asleep but the recent increase in ads made me change podcasts."
8820,"Where does one get this podcast? Stupid question I know. Can I get it possibly as a channel for steaming TV, like through YouTube or anything? Sorry, new to podcasting!!"
8821,Let's learn everything and the weirdest thing I learned this week are similar for fun things that are also educational.  I'm enjoying NSTAAF too! :)
8822,This one is really good 
8823,I love QI but IDK I just have never been able to get into TNSTAAF.
8824,I remember there being an episode of Radiolab named this! it was fascinating!
8825,100%. It's fantastic.
8826,That was my suggestion!
8827,Love this one
8828,This isnthe very first podcast I ever listened too and I love it.
8829,"Glad to see this here! Also the show they're from, QI, is a great watch of similar theme. Interesting stuff (quite interesting), presented by comedians and entertainers, not boring science people."
8830,My favorite random facts podcasts
8831,Came here for this. Made me actively look forward to my 40 minute commute to and from work.
8832,I just finished smashing through it from start to finish
8833,Not sure about some of the recent new hosts though...
8834,"The story about the inflatable set of MacBeth was one of the funniest things I've ever listened to, great show "
8835,My favourite podcast!!!
8836,Is it about fish haha
8837,Great book.
8838,What's it about? I'm loking for more pods to follow
8839,I miss Anna
8840,"Fish and Off Menu are the only podcasts I really listen to, like every episode, and I enjoy the fuck out of them. And Katherine Ryan's, but that's a verrrry different speed."
8841,"I agree I love this podcast! It talks about the most random things, and in a way that I remember it even after years."
8842,"I agree, although I found the name to be quite misleading"
8843,"I've been listening to this as well. The episode on freakanomics made me cringe at myself for thinking so highly of the book when it came out. 

The rich dad poor dad episode was super good. I was dying laughing at some of the examples they pulled from the book such as make more money by joining and mlm"
8844,Seconding this! One of the hosts is part of another podcast called Maintenance Phase that is similarly very well researched and all about debunking and bursting myths and getting to the bottom of things.
8845,Dude the one on Rich Dad Poor Dad was awesome. Michael Hobbes is awesome.
8846,"He also did a podcast called You're Wrong About with Sarah Marshall, who is equally amazing."
8847,"Anybody willing to rip Rich Dad, Poor Dad a new asshole gets a thumbs up from me, it's pretty iconic for how goddamn out of touch with reality all of the Boomers are"
8848,"Michael and Peter are great. 

Also check out 5-4 Peter's other podcast about why the Supreme Court sucks"
8849,"Caveat. Their analysis seems to be very critical and condescending of anything right of far left. 

Ex. Reduced Jonathon Haidt to a middle age man complaining about what the kids are doing. I get they're also trying to bring humor, but if that's the best introduction you can give him then it's hard for me to value their perspective."
8850,"Michael is also on Maintenance Phase which is excellent and well researched too!

Peter has another podcast called 5-4 which is about how much the Supreme Court sucks. It has 2 other lawyers on it and is informative, hilarious and infuriating."
8851,One of them (Michael Hobbes) has another great podcast called 'Maintenance Phase' that debunks diet/health nonsense. Funny AND interesting.
8852,"The ""men are from mars"" episode made me lol so hard"
8853,"Then you can go listen to all the podcast by micheal Hobbs and his friends cause they are all great. Your wrong about, maintainance phase and so on"
8854,I love that they kept coming back to the source of rich dad's wealth: tricking that one kid into child slave labor and tax fraud.
8855,"I kinda found the hosts to be insufferable, even by podcast standards"
8856,"I checked this out because I'm into airport non-fiction/self-help in a weird so-bad-it's-good kind of way and never really found anyone who shares this passion. 

I listened through 3 episodes and I'm done.

I started with Rich Dad Poor Dad, which I haven't read. Found the episode enjoyable enough. Like a snarky tl;dr with some decent background on something I was only vaguely familiar with. I already held some preconceptions for the book and they pretty much confirmed them. It wasn't outright offensive so I moved on, starting from the beginning of the series.

Now Freakanomics and Gladwell I have read. And hated. And for the most part agreed with what IBCK had to say.

But god damn did these guys become insufferable, once I knew what they were actually talking about. It is beyond ironic that they engage in the exact same BS that airport books get hate for to begin with. They just cherry pick, generalize, misconstrue and take giant leaps to conclusions in their very own way - just like the books they are shitting on. All the while somehow holding some kind of moral superiority to fuel their indignation or some quip that isn't that funny to begin with. They had no criticism to offer that wasn't immediately apparent when reading the book and no subject matter expertise beyond *""a quick google search""* (which they would use as their constant and only source)

The thing about airport books I detest is that they are product of a culture wherein anyone is an expert if you know how to spend 5 mins on google. I didn't expect the same from someone who intends to tear these books apart for a living, all the while being so smug and self-righteous about it. From what I've gathered (with a quick google search) these two are merely professional podcasters?"
8857,"The whole ecosystem that Mike and Sara built from ""You're Wrong about"" is great. We got ""You are Good"", ""Maintenance Phase"", and ""If books Could Kill"".

And it all started with Sara and Mike in their closets recording ""You're wrong about"""
8858,"How is ""the Secret"" non-fiction?"
8859,Not sure if i want to subscribe to this one but I'm definitely listening to that Rich Dad Poor Dad episode. That was a required reading book in one of my undergrad courses and it was awful. Full of garbage pop economics and steaming hot shit.
8860,"Maintenance phase, you're wrong about, and 5-4 are all podcasts you should also listen to if you like this one"
8861,Some of them are good but the chaps are particularly self righteous
8862,"I have very mixed feelings on this one. I really enjoyed the books *Freakonomics* and *Outliers* back in the day--but was extremely amused by their takedown of those books. I thought the episodes were really funny and wanted to share it with everyone I'd ever discussed those books with.

However, I got to *The Coddling of the American Mind*, which I'm currently reading, and most of their dunks and arguments were pretty disingenuous. The book has this conceit of three great untruths, like ""What doesn't kill you makes you weaker"", that the authors suggest are the logical underpinnings or extensions of the developments they criticize. When I turned on the podcast, the hosts were all, ""I don't know anyone who believes *that*"" but the whole point was that it wasn't really anyone's explicit argument, so it seemed like they were ignoring the fairly-clear actual message of the book.

So I'm curious how I'll feel about episodes on books I remember well or read recently, even if the dunking is fun."
8863,Oh man I need to email them about the time I went out with Neil Strauss. I had locked that memory away until their episode about The Game.
8864,"This podcast is SO good. I laughed out loud at the episode on Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus. Extra funny because my mum took this as such gospel truth and I really thought it was such amazing insight as a teenager. It's refreshing honestly."
8865,"Yikes, they don't seem to get The Coddling of the American Mind at all. I sympathize with the podcasters bc when I read that book I went in thinking it was gonna be Millennials Are Snowflakes the book. What I actually read was really good and nuanced imo. 

They have a smug left liberal bias and just wanted to bash the book. This is very evident in their discussion of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. They don't know what CBT is and don't know why The Coddling discusses it... It's blatantly not about exposing ppl to traumas. Some googling (or just reading the book) would have shown that."
8866,"I love how high up this is!!!! I adore this podcast and I am learning so much (un-learning so much?) It has just the perfect mix of righteous indignation, science, and compassion."
8867,This is a great podcast. Two very intelligent hosts with good chemistry and low tolerance for bullshit.
8868,"This podcast is a super group basically, as Michael and Peter are both ridiculously accomplished on other podcasts. And I no shit believe Peter is the funniest person in the history of podcasting. He hits hard and pulls zero punches, a true savage."
8869,"I love this one, their takedown of ""the coddling of the American mind"" had me laughing out loud- especially given it was a prescribed text for a subject I'm studying and I hated everything about it"
8870,Definitely checking this out. Skepticism and criticism of pop books is so juicy. There are so many authors that deserve the dissection. Yuval Harari and Malcolm Gladwell come to mind.
8871,I like the sound of it but I'm hesitant because Outliers helped me out of a dark patch and they reviewed it...
8872,Michael used to do one called 'you're wrong about' that was/is an excellent podcast
8873,"I listen to the first episode, or maybe it was on the second, and their assumptions is really bad, they have no scientifically evidence on anything they claim and are sometime just bitter at their own life, shame because they try to do something good."
8874,michael hobbes is one of the best podcasters out there imo
8875,I thought this podcast is kind of dumb.  I spent 15 minutes listening after reading this thread. They spent most of the time making dumb jokes on the stories that have nothing to do with the points the book was trying to make.
8876,I love Michael Hobbs (big fan of Maintenance Phase and You're Wrong About) but couldn't get into this one.
8877,"Great show, also the other show Michael was on, Your Wrong About. They go over stories from the past that the media got completely wrong, then later corrected but now everyone remembers the wrong version of events"
8878,"I love anything with Michael Hobbes - If Books Could Kill, Maintenance Phase, You're Wrong About"
8879,"YES

Came here to just name taht podcast! Im loving it so far!"
8880,"Solid choice. I appreciate they're honest about the small number of bits they found interesting, but them breaking down the bs is fantastic."
8881,I just found this podcast and they're awesome!
8882,"There is a podcast called ""The Worst Best Sellers"" which has existed a lot longer than this one. I suggest listening to both, as I'm a huge fan of IBCK, Maintenance Phase, and You're Wrong About. TWBS has been around longer so it has a bigger archive to dig into."
8883,"You should check out Not Your Grandmother's Book Club as well. It's a similar premise, where the hosts read crappy right-wing books by people like Dinesh D'Souza and Glen Beck. A bit less research and more opinion, but very fun."
8884,I came here to suggest this. It is just amazing! Fun and informative. A great listen
8885,"Yeeeeeees! I'm listening to all of Michael's podcasts now. If you're a debunkaholic like me, you'll likely enjoy You're Wrong About, which is his earliest podcast that I'm aware of."
8886,Cybersecurity guy here... Rhysider gets a lot of things right and cares about the community.
8887,That's the one I'm into right now. It's very good!
8888,One of the two podcasts I'll always listen to as soon as an episode is released. The other is 99% Invisible.
8889,"My brother listened to the bank robber episode as he was literally penetrating a bank vault for work. I'm not a professional, but the fact professionals listen and love is a huge mark of quality."
8890,Every episode is a consistently good listen. Excited that it's no longer on hiatus (glad the host took some time off though).
8891,I don't know anything about tech and I find this podcast really interesting. Jack makes it very easy to follow and understand what's going on in each story.
8892,Darknet Diaries is the tittz. I love the pentest stories. Especially when people literally end up in jail even when they have permission because some gubbermint cross department beef
8893,The couple of episodes about NSO are so good
8894,"""And even though I have to smash my hard drives and buy a new computer every time I say it...

This....

...

*is darknet diaries*"""
8895,"Some episodes are gold, while he is ham-fistedly overdoing the drama of it in others. Hit or miss for me."
8896,"His intro gets me so pumped. "" I'M...... *brief pause*... JackRhysiser and this is DarknetDiaries """
8897,"Love this, especially the story telling format with interviews."
8898,I got into Click Here while he was talking a mental health break.
8899,"I just commented this. Excellent podcast and good to see this so highly upvoted. I love that he has a lot of guests on almost every episode ranging from convicted hackers, FBI agents, investigators, and more. Really good insight from these guys on how they got up to their level, how they got caught, how their investigation progressed, etc etc."
8900,"This podcast motivated me to learn cyber security online and I went from working as a restaurant manager to a network analyst in 3 years time at the start of COVID. 

I fucking love Jack."
8901,Sometimes I wish he got more technical
8902,"Darknet Diaries are a fascinating listen to how people got into hacking, what they did and how they did it. It's been a great listen for me, easily one of the best things I discovered during the pandemic"
8903,Surprised to see this one here. It's just such a niche topic but yeah it's terrific. The episode on LinkedIn might be my favorite podcast episode of any podcast. What a wild ride.
8904,"I live deep in the cyber world, so I'm always on the lookout for good cyber podcasts. Darknet Diaries gets it right - interesting stories with an extremely engaging host. Jack can tell a story and I walk away both entertained and having learned something. That's the perfect formula for a podcast for me. 

The rest are extremely dry, entirely too technical, or just dull in general."
8905,I just find some of the guests a bit cringe.
8906,"I was watching an episode of Darknet Diaries earlier, and I swear to Christ one of my friends randomly messaged me as I was watching asking how to access the dark web."
8907,The Beirut Bankjob episode is one of my favorite hours of podcasting. Jayson E Street is a really fun storyteller
8908,Love that this is up here. Not a cybersec guy myself but fuck if it isn't fascinating
8909,"On the back of this, even though I don't think it's going anymore, Reply All was good."
8910,is he back yet ?
8911,I know very little about the subject matter but I really enjoy this one too.
8912,"This 100%...I can't believe how far this is up on the list, but I was about to comment the exact same thing."
8913,"Definitely one of the more entertaining cybersecurity podcasts. The episode with the Canadian DOOD making counterfeit American twenties is great, and Owl Stalker solving the Puerto Rican lottery case is also great."
8914,"Messaged jack thanking him for his podcast and he wrote back being really appreciative and sincere. Been following this podcast from the start, and from someone who has no real expertise in the area, I thoroughly enjoy the listen."
8915,Do anyone happen to know if that podcast counts for CPEs?
8916,"I just started this one thanks to this post. This one's great. The episode about VTech surprised me. I thought any company dealing with data about kids, especially one that's been around as long as they have, would have had better security in place from the start."
8917,Came here for this. I'm working in IT myself (but not in Security) and I can learn from every episode.
8918,I listen to a lot of pod casts and check out new ones when I see these types of threads. Darknet Diaries is by far my favorite one I have discovered in recent years. Sometimes I go back and listen to old episodes all over again lol.
8919,+1 for this one
8920,My husband listens to this. Anytime I'm in the car with him he plays podcasts so I've heard many episodes of this show. It's really interesting. I really liked all the pen tester episodes. I haven't been able to listen to it since I had our son. The last episode I heard before giving birth was about the child porn problem. That episode destroyed me.
8921,Ayy we got the same bandana
8922,"Nice to see it brought up, it's such an amazing production!"
8923,"Came to say this! Amazing podcast. Where else can you hear people spill the beans on how they pulled off (nearly) epic heists and schemes. The recent episode - about the guy who sold drugs on the Darknet forums - is fascinating. The guy gives full details about how he built up from making comments in black-market forums to being a top seller and moderator, how he got caught, and how he got out of jail quick. IIRC he went to jail for like 18 months even though he could have ended up doing life. It's amazing how Jack can pull off this kind of an interview - he is a genius."
8924,I listen to this regularly. Addictive! And I've learned a lot about my own cyber security.
8925,"And then there's Hard Fork for when you want to know more about Blockchain, AI and newer technologies.

Darknet Diaries was my starting point though."
8926,Worth it for the jokes.
8927,Honestly don't like the host voice but some of the stories are fantastic. Anyone who wants to get started listen to the PPP episode
8928,Similar to this is 'Hacked'. One of my favs as well
8929,Love that intro
8930,First podcast I really got into besides Hamish and Andy
8931,"I'm so glad to see this one not only listed in the thread, but toward the top! This is such a good podcast."
8932,This.
8933,Stoked to see this so high. Great popdcast and makes cybersecurity more accessible. Love it
8934,Love this one. Glad he's back from his break!
8935,"I always imagine the host as being Kermit with a hood on, like from the meme."
8936,Start with the pizza episode!
8937,I stumbled upon this a couple months ago and just finished binge listening. So many episodes are insightful and mindblowing. Gollumfun was such a rollercoaster.
8938,"Operation Raven was listed as supplemental material in a unit of my Fundamentals of Cybersecurity class. I gave it a listen, loved it, and have been hooked since."
8939,Is this accessible to non-infosec / non-computersci folks?
8940,Glad to see so much love for this here. We listen on car trips and I'm still amazed that there is so much to this topic - he always finds something new and fascinating to scare the shit out of you with...
8941,Just listening to his latest episode. So glad he came back from his break!
8942,"I also like Malicious Life, but nothing is as good as Jack"
8943,I love when people inside an industry tell stories of that industry from their unique perspective. Wasted Truth is one that does that with the bar/service industry. So funny and raw.
8944,"It's just about the only podcast I can bear to listen to, got me through some very long drives."
8945,"Tried to get back into this recently, but I find Jack's voice so soothing it just makes me sleepy "
8946,Came looking to make sure this was mentioned. Honestly he breaks technical concepts down for those less technical as well. It's amazing hearing the bizarre stories that never would be told if it weren't for this podcast.
8947,100% that podcast. It's better than every Hollywood movie that wants to portrait how cool hacking and infosec is. Jack Hyde had me question everything.
8948,This.
8949,"i Know this is not what the show consists of, but everytime I see this podcast when I'm browsing in google podcasts all I can think of is each episode consisting either of these 2 scenarios:

1. Someone using the darknet only to order drugs and then getting bummed out when they get the wrong thing or nothing
2. Older folks going on there and somehow getting scammed

EDIT: Hotchie Matchie! Apparently a lot of folks think this is what I think all the dark web has to offer or something. I stated when I see the podcast titles Darknet **Diaries** it's all that pops in my head! It's mainly the word Diary! It just reminds me of all those cheesy hall mark holiday movies....""The Christmas Diaries"" doesn't that sound like you can picture passing it in the TV listings? 

I think the dark web can be whatever you make it, good and bad."
8950,Came here to say this^^
8951,"Wash your hands, you filthy animals"
8952,/r/TPWKY needs more growth
8953,I loved this pod! Then Covid came around and kinda made it less fun but I still listen if it's something irresistible. The diptheria and cholera episodes are iconic.
8954,Thank you! I was reading all the entries and wondering why no one else would give it love. One of my absolute favorites.
8955,I had to scroll too far to find this!! The cholera epi is probably my fav but they are all fantastic.
8956,"Yeassss I scrolled all this way to find this one! It's so much fun. I actually laughed out loud at their old timey method of getting rid of warts, which was to wipe it on someone else's private parts I think, without them noticing 

I also really have to recommend In the Dark, the Curtis Flowers series - a man who was being tried for the *sixth* time for the same crime, and had been in jail and had sentences overturned and then tried again for the last 20 years. The podcast started during the 6th trial and the deep investigative journalism of the podcast actually influenced the outcome of the situation. I was following it live in 2019 as it was happening, and it completely blew me away."
8957,It's quarantini time!
8958,"yesss, this is also one of my favourites"
8959,What excellent timing for me to read this. I'm in the process of getting diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder and the most recent episode is about lupus. Thanks for the rec!
8960,Fuckin love them
8961,The fact that they have the same first name really threw me off for a while. Super interesting podcast though.
8962,"I love this podcast will kill you, though when lack of time makes me choose,  Sawbones wins every time. I super highly recommend it to any TPWKY fans and vice versa"
8963,"It's so good. I've learned so much and end up spouting random facts about syphilis and anthrax that probably no one wants to hear, haha"
8964,Thank you for this recommendation. I just subscribed and the most recent episode is about lupus. My sister has Lupus and I want to learn as much as I can about it. A podcast will be a refreshing change from online articles.
8965,Another top one for me. I learned a TON about diseases I never gave a thought to. Because I'm vaccinated. The one on diphtheria gave me nightmares.
8966,The WW1 series may be one of the best podcast series I've ever listened to. Completely rocked my world and made me realize I knew NOTHING about that war.
8967,"Quote:
*Proceeds to describe the most horrific event you've ever heard*
End quote."
8968,"Less a podcast, more a full length audiobook that's released every 4-6 months.

It's audio gold."
8969,The King of Kings series are my favorite podcast episodes. Listened to them a few times.
8970,I thought supernova in the east was phenomenal
8971,I get so pumped every time he drops a new episode. 4 hours or more of epic storytelling.
8972,I love how first episode is 15 minutes long and now he releases BLITZ almost six hours long.
8973,Buck an episode. It's all they ask.
8974,"Celtic Holocaust. How an essentially pan-european cultural phenomenon dating back to the bronze age was wiped out systemically and assimilated, all because of a national grudge."
8975,"His WWI episodes as well as the episode about the development of the nuclear bomb are THE best, I believe. I've listened to each at least 5 times through"
8976,The one on Slavery was really amazing and quite well done!
8977,wow this was exactly what I came to type. I did not know that it was *that* popular with people.
8978,How do you get the older episodes? Audible only has the last 10 or so.
8979,"It's really good but you can tell he's a journalist and not a historian, sometimes he gets a little wild."
8980,Dan Carlin is the truth
8981,"""Ghosts of the Ostfront"" is the best piece of audio content I've ever experienced; music included."
8982,"I've seen Hardcore History recommended a few times and tried to get into it but couldn't. It felt like I was listening to a high school history teacher trying to trick me into thinking history is cool, as opposed to Mike Duncan from history of Rome/revolutions where I feel I'm listening to a guy who loves history and assumes I do to since I'm listening to a history podcast."
8983,EndQUOTE.
8984,Am I the only one who can't stand his overly theatrical voice/narration?
8985,I second this one!
8986,The recent series has been pretty rambly.
8987,I like his content but his delivery is very jarring at times. He talks about very dry details like fairly mundane meetings with generals like he's describing being inside a nuclear bomb when it detonates.
8988,Who knew gengis khan was a green eyed ginger?
8989,Came here to say this too. It's unbelievably good.
8990,What does that look like folks??
8991,Where? How?
8992,"Eh I would be careful with this. Go to AskHistorians on Reddit and ask them what they think about his work. According to most of them, it's not very good, he gets a lot wrong. 

Not tryin to be a hater, I really wanted to like his podcast but I just can't with his work not being very accurate"
8993,"Also i really liked the destroyer of worlds. Afterwards i read command and control. 
It's such ana amazing episode and teaches you really about nuclear weapons how close we got to the execution of M.A.D. 

Then i bought the WW1 episode and ouh box did it show me a better picture of war. 

Because of it i watched it quiet on the western front and it just reminded me that the numbers a single people who lived and where a lot younger than me.

Edit: the green field of France just got a whole different ring to it."
8994,"I've got thick skin but the Addicted to Bondage episode, man I had to pause that a couple of times because it was just too intense and emotional listening to first person accounts on how slaves were treated."
8995,The way Dan Carlin tells it is amazing!!
8996,Where can I listen it mate?
8997,"Just wanna add ""Revolutions"" from Mike Duncan if you haven't gotten around to that one yet already, that dude is an incredible historian!"
8998,I was searching for History of Rome. I'm about 3/4s done the series and don't know how I'll manage after it's over. I think hardcore history is the next one.
8999,"Tides of History by Patrick Wyman is also great, covers all sorts of history"
9000,Also the spiritual successor to The History of Rome - The History of Byzantium.
9001,History of Rome is amazing. It was exactly what I was looking for.
9002,Really enjoy all of these. Rest is history is really good for something light-hearted and their banter is charming.
9003,"Just recently found The Rest is History and I've already listened to at least 100 episodes.  So many great ones: The Kaba, Atlantis, Ronald Reagan..."
9004,Also You're Dead To Me
9005,"When Mike was about 3/4 of the way through his History of Rome podcast, myself and about 30 other fans got to go Rome with him on his first trip there.  He is very gracious, down to Earth guy who loves sharing his hobby with everyone."
9006,"History of England - probably the closest to Mike Duncan's podcasting quality I know of. His members only shedcast is also gold, with a variety of tangential topics, including the history of Scotland.


History of Byzantium 

Tides of History - probably the most ""showy"" of my podcasts, but far, far less bombastic than HH. All over history, with seasons focussing on topics, and a more noticeable focus on normal people's lives than usual.

Wittenberg to Westphalia - despite the name, it starts in the early middle ages to explain the background that would lead to the reformation. Currently around the investiture conflict, though Benjamin Jacobs currently seems to have other things going on."
9007,"Revolutions by Mike Duncan should be listened to by everyone who has voting rights.

So that they know why and how they got that right, and why and how they should protect it like a treasure.

It just connects so many things from your school topics in civics, history, political science, sociology, with tweets you see today.

You can see things that happen now and see how it impacts history.

It's long, but brilliant. I took 2 years to finish it"
9008,The History of Rome is my emotional support podcast. Ive listened through it multiple times now
9009,"I stumbled upon ""The Rest Is History"" lately, and it's quickly becoming one of my favourite podcasts."
9010,"The Rest Is History is awesome.

Also, if into global and UK politics, The Rest Is Politics is great."
9011,"If you liked history of Rome, I can only recommend the British History Podcast."
9012,Fall of Civilizations
9013,"I've been looking for a history podcast to make me see the big picture, cause-and-effect dynamic of the 18th-20th centuries. My school knowledge of history is shaky, and I'd like to improve.

Do you recommend either of these as a ""very little prior knowledge required"" podcast? Bonus points if it has a chronological structure. 

I enjoyed the philosophy podcast *Philosophize this* for the same reasons."
9014,Check out The Age of Napoleon if u enjoy Mike Duncan's stuff!
9015,The rest is history is fun if very surface level. They usually do not spend enough time on topics and only get the most basic information out.
9016,I love Rest is History!  Just about to finish the 100 Years War ones
9017,Also Our Fake History.
9018,"Fall of Civilizations podcast is my favorite history podcast.

Myths and Legends is also worth a listen and probably interests a similar crowd."
9019,IMO Revolutions is a better one for the average listener. HoR is really long
9020,I've just discovered the rest is history and listened to the first 10 episodes in a week.
9021,Fall of Civilizations and History on Fire are two other excellent history podcast
9022,You're Dead To Me - Greg Jenner. Funny and sometimes obscure history
9023,Fall of Civilizations fits in this list as well.
9024,I love rest is history.
9025,Am inordinately large part of my life went into that podcast. It really changed the way I look at the world.
9026,I love The History of English
9027,The Hellenistic Age Podcast is also an incredible history podcast.
9028,You may like Names You Should Know too 
9029,I think you have a type.
9030,"I'm just going to drop in the History of English in here.

The first few episodes broke my brain when it covered what we know about the Proto-Indo-European language. So fascinating.

Also I love etymology so that helps."
9031,"The Rest is History is my favourite, the banter makes it so entertaining."
9032,I'd add to that Tides of History
9033,"In listening to The Rest is History right now.
I really enjoyed during the Wolf Cup their history of the World Cup and feature of each country in the competition"
9034,Second all of these!
9035,"What gets me about the rest is history is how Tom Holland just already knows everything. Like Hardcore history is great, and Dan puts so much research into every episode. But Tom just shows up twice a week and can answer basically any question about history. Like the difference in rap between putting out an album and being able to freestyle"
9036,"Since you are posting a lot about history I would also suggest Fall of Civilizations, it's super well put together and covers topics about fallen empires/civilizations I never knew existed."
9037,Oh YEAH I enjoy the rest is history as well. They have so many different topics
9038,Don't forget the History of Byzantium continuation of the History of Rome podcast
9039,"Those are great, but do you have any podcast recommendations on history?"
9040,History on fire is fabulous as well.
9041,"Recently started the rest is history, it's fantastic"
9042,"What is the difference between Dan Carlin' ""Hardcore History"" and ""Hardcore History: Addendum""?"
9043,Stuff You Missed in History Class is pretty good
9044,The history of Rome was fantastic! The rest of Mike Duncan's stuff went downhill fast IMO
9045,"In beautiful, ~~downtown~~ uptown Oakland California"
9046,I so want to like that show but binging it is a constant job of taking up your phone over and over to skip over half the show as its just adds.
9047,Came here for this. I listen to a lot of podcasts and recommend based on the person except this - everyone should listen to 99% Invisible. Partly just because Roman Mars has a great voice
9048,what's it about?
9049,"If you like 99% invisible, you should check out radiolab."
9050,"Their episode where they found out that for some reason, their podcast crashs the audio system of a very specific car (like make, model, and year specific) was really fun. It had to do with a glitch in the programming of the car stereo that their Podcast title just happens to fuck with."
9051,"That episode Invisible Women really was a punch in the gut. 

Primarily about how women are left out of important design choices like automotive safety and are thus more likely to die in crashes. Left out of medical and drug research and more likely to be misdiagnosed or improperly medicated, etc.  It's a great look into how uncritical design choices have large scale, mostly negative, impacts on half the population"
9052,Seems like there's a lot of episodes. Got a recommendation for a starting point?
9053,An absolutely amazing podcast. Roman Mars is good at what he does.
9054,"Also, What Roman Mars Can Learn About Con Law,  
formerly called What Trump Can Teach Us About Con Law"
9055,So many ads though
9056,"I've listened to one episode which happened to talk about a town I know really well. It was horrible. He got so many things completely backwards that it really turned me off the podcast. 

If someone talks Bs about something I know a lot about, how am I supposed to trust them on topics where I have no means of fact checking?"
9057,99% Adbreaks
9058,"First episode in, great podcast so far."
9059,"It's a radiolab clone, they did it better first."
9060,It's hard to get past that so many episodes have content that's shorter than the two commercial breaks on either end.
9061,Whats it about?
9062,It's too short
9063,That's the one.
9064,"First time I ever heard of the podcast is when Roman was on with Chuck Bryant's ""Movie Crush"" discussing Jaws. Decided to give it a listen and was instantly hooked."
9065,Second this and pretty much anything from radiotopia
9066,"One of the classics! This one has been around for a long time and it continues to be a force for design in our modern world.

Not to mention Roman Mars is smooth AF."
9067,"I'm listening to ""Part Two: How the first fitness influencer doomed us all"" right now.

That guy killed his baby.  Probably.  Maybe.  Allegedly.  Should send an R9X Knife Missile his way."
9068,"This was the podcast, that taught me about Combat General Brett Hawthorne..."
9069,You know what won't make you question humanity? The tastey feeling of some cool ranch doritos on in your mouth. Doritos - probably never directly caused a genocide.
9070,That Henry Kissinger 6 parter though...
9071,Shhhhh... people are gonna learn about the child hunting island that a certain food delivery service maintains
9072,Billy Wayne Davis needs to come back...
9073,"Oh wow it's hosted by Robert Evans, was a fan of his from the Worst Year Ever pod - will def check it out"
9074,Second this! And then you can listen to Cool People Who Did Cool Stuff to go in the opposite direction!
9075,I'm learning so many things about history that got glossed over or completely ignored in my schooling. I like being informed. The accompanying depression is just an added bonus.
9076,"I randomly came across that podcast a few years ago in a Ted Cruz thread, I got hooked because Evans is really funny, and within a year I was looking for mutual aid groups to volunteer with. I've probably read more in the last couple years than I did in the preceding decade."
9077,The Facebook one.. Just letting a genocide happen...
9078,Just started listening. The facism episodes at the start of the podcast are intense.
9079,Came her to post behind the Bastards. Robert Evans is an amazing story teller
9080,The one about Thalidomide was really good. Thank goodness for the FDA and Frances Oldham Kelsey if you were in the US.
9081,"In a different but similar vein, also friends / sometime guests of BTB, a podcast called Knowledge Fight. Robert Evans has also guest hosted on their podcast and regularly mentions that it is one of his favorite podcasts.

Knowledge Fight is a podcast that has been going on for like 7 years now that follows Alex Jones' show and closely catalogues, critiques, and makes fun of the extreme right wing conspiracy theory world. It's pretty amazing - and still manages to be fun (though that shit does still get sad and dark because that world is fucked up). I found it after Jan 6 and have regularly listened ever since...and listened to all of he back catalogue.."
9082,"Seconding Behind the Bastards. Some of my favorite episodes (going way back to the beginning of the podcast):

- It Takes A Village of Bastards to Make A Weinstein (2018) (so infuriating to see how many people excused his behavior for sooo many years just to butter their own bread)

- King Leopold II: The First Modern Bastard (2018) (the bastard of all bastards.)

- The Child Molester Whose Sex Cult Taught Women Friendship (2018) (About the NXIVM sex cult and it's super creepy af POS leader Kieth Raniere)

- The Astrologer Who Managed The Reagan Presidency (2018) (Insanity all around)


I really need to get back to this podcast. Elizabeth Holmes, Mark Zuckerberg, Alex Jones, Steven Seagal for heaven's sake!! I bet that one is fantastic!"
9083,How do you feel about nuking the great lakes region? There will be frilly toothpicks.
9084,I cannot wait for the Vince McMahon episode.
9085,I love Bastards when I can handle it. It's such a downer. There are several eps I haven't been able to finish. Those segues into the sponsors are always funny though.
9086,"Decided to listen due to this suggestion. 

Which one should I start with?"
9087,Yes! I love their podcast!
9088,Straight up the *only* podcast I listen to at this point.
9089,I literally unsubscribed to this one because I was losing my faith in humanity
9090,Interesting subject matter but I couldn't stand the hosts.
9091,Gonna need my throwing bagels
9092,"I enjoy the stories, but the comedy is a bit forced."
9093,"The guy that killed Santa in front of the children :((

Also, fuck the great lakes"
9094,"I like the content, the comedic style has seen better days."
9095,I really want to like Behind the Bastards but I can't stand the guests that he has on. They are SO uninteresting.
9096,"It will also make you believe in the power of machecine.

And a good pair of bolt cutters."
9097,Everyone should listen to the Steven Seagal 2 part episode.
9098,The Zuckerberg two parter needs to be part of the national curriculum
9099,Their episodes on Justice Clarence Thomas are some of my favorite podcasts ever.
9100,"I'll throw cold water on this: they aren't very good.

I used to listen all the time, thinking, ""Oh, man, there's so much I didn't know!"" 

And then I listened to one I actually knew something about--i.e., did my thesis on and had done extensive research on, and they just made a bunch of shit up.

They do what the People You Disagree With do all the time: they take a small kernel of truth, then build an extremely biased narrative around that kernel to weave the story they want to tell, not the truth. At the *very* least, the commit the sin of providing absolutely no context whatsoever with most of their research. 

It might be fun to listen to, but the content is just as bad as (insert content creator you politically disagree with).

Edit: I see a lot of ""I just listen for entertainment"" but that's not an excuse. Someone like this can't want to be taken seriously and considered a source of goof information and then when someone called them out say ""Oh ho ho, I'm just a dookie wakka-wakka modern-day jester! Don't take me seriously!"" (I have the same problem with Jon Stewart.) You can't have it both ways."
9101,"My issue with this pod is what the whoever is brought on as a guest can make or break the episode. If you're bringing someone in constantly chipping in with shit jokes ""oh Stalin should have swiped left"" or ""you got some splaining to doooo"" then that's a complete episode skip for me."
9102,Came here to say this. Went through entire catalog in a year... now I wait every week to hear about horrible humans
9103,I like this and think that it has a lot of great deep dives. However I already battle with enough mental weight that I can't deal with the headspace it puts me in anymore.
9104,"I like the show, but the host gets kind of annoying after a while. He has a nasally voice and he obviously finds himself extremely amusing."
9105,"The main guy, cant remember his name, is pretty annoying IMO

I just find he often makes really flat jokes at really bad times. 

That being said, I still enjoy it outside of those moments, it's a solid podcast. They cover a lot of interesting material."
9106,"very different to the others in this list and worth a listen.  It's in theory about reviewing certain parts of the human world, but think deeply personal and well crafted auditory essays framed around those things written by a good author rather than a pure fact dump.  Has space not to take itself too seriously at points as well."
9107,"This is maybe my favorite. Every episode wells me up a bit. The one about the kid in the ER and the one about the last bird make me cry. There's something so beautiful about how he lays out the episodes, it's so amazing."
9108,I'm so sad he stopped doing this
9109,"John Green has another podcast with Hank Green too, they give weekly dubious advice and talk about some really interesting stuff. Its called Dear Hank and John (to be renamed Dear John and Hank if man hasn't set foot on mars by 2028) It's lots of fun, highly recommend if you haven't checked it out"
9110,Along the same lines (short audio essays about arbitrary topics told in a poignant way) check out **The Memory Palace**.
9111,The segments on Googling Strangers and the Potato Seeds of Leningrad haunted me. John's relief on discovering on social media that someone he thought was dead is actually alive and has been thriving for years and his retelling on how the scientists at the seed bank in the Siege of Leningrad protected to their death what was the world's largest seed collection at that time stayed with me long after the episodes ended.
9112,I love this podcast and am really bummed it seems to have ended. I really enjoyed every episode.
9113,There's a book too!
9114,My favorite as well.
9115,Noted. Never heard it but now I will
9116,I think this podcast got me through the pandemic more than anything else.
9117,Is it him expounding on the topics from the book or is it more of just an audiobook where he's reading each chapter?
9118,"The Backpackers Guide to Prehistory

It is an absolutely fantastic show. Super clever and novel way to talk about it."
9119,"Yup. The episode about the rugby team stranded in the Andes had me feeling *every* emotion. What else is there to do when rescuers are finally on their way and a young man screams ""avalanche"" but spreads everyone with a fire extinguisher but to laugh and then cry a bit?"
9120,Their Diana series was amazing!
9121,"Came here to suggest this. 

Their series about the DC Sniper Attacks was amazing, I had no idea it was about John Allen Mohammed's abuse of his wife. Mildred is a fucking strong woman."
9122,I love the Princess Diana series so much!
9123,Great podcast but I miss Mike.
9124,"This was the first podcast I ever experienced. I had completely gutted my attic area to turn it into an art studio and I listened to two years worth of You're Wrong About while fixing the place up.

Previously i just assumed podcasts were just boring regular people talking about...idk, boring life stuff. Unfortunately, or fortunately depending on your views, it did push me into good ol' true crime podcasts and now that's mostly what I listen to. Sprinkle some spooky history like Lore in there, maybe some silly Internet Urban Legends, and I'm set."
9125,"Favorite of mine for years. I love Sarah and Mike's dynamic, I know Mike leaves eventually but I'm still working my way through the old episodes."
9126,Her most recent episode about Sinead O'Connor was so good and just deeply upsetting. Sinead is kind of a phenomenal person. I also echo the person below about the Andes plane crash episode. I think I felt every emotion while listening
9127,The episode they did with Amanda Knox was really great.
9128,I have a hard time focusing on podcasts but this one always has my attention. That and S Town.
9129,"I love You're Wrong About, but this is a very hit-or-miss show with me. The episodes about gang and satanic panic were really paradigm-altering, but then they have so many episodes about some Hollywood star. The stakes and my interests in them vary dramatically from episode to episode. When it's good it's super fantastic, though."
9130,I miss when it was Michael and Sarah
9131,I loved it before Michael Hobbs left. I still have so much love and respect for Sarah Marshall but the show has lost something without him.
9132,"I liked this show a lot, but their Tom Cruise episode ruined them for me. The narrative they painted of Cruise being a victim while entirely underplaying his role as an official and funder of Scientology is disgusting. It's either negligently ignorant or intentionally misleading."
9133,Love Sarah Marshall and will listen to any podcast episode she does as long as she doesn't have the guest Clementine Ford on
9134,"Just the Gist is similar, but I prefer it over you're wrong about."
9135,It's so good!!
9136,YES. My current podcast obsession
9137,It took far too long to scroll and find this
9138,"Terrible, terrible podcast. Hosts have a cringy ""conversation"" with an underlying tone that they're better than everyone else but maybe their audience, while giving their banal ""insights.""  I've never been more disappointed trying out a new podcast."
9139,it's a bit simplistic. You might like radiolab though
9140,Is that the real name of the podcast?
9141,"They absolutely butchered the Matthew Shepard episode, unfortunately. I did like the Tanya Harding one though."
9142,This is definitely one of my favorites! I love the approach they take and that one of the two people has limited knowledge on whatever it is.
9143,"Love that podcast, I got into Matience Phase too. Michael Hobbs is on that one too"
9144,"It's okay. I like the idea behind it. But a lot of episodes aren't really about common misconceptions, and the hosts' biases are sometimes a bit heavy-handed and closed-minded for my liking. But occasionally I still listen in."
9145,"That sounds interesting, I just followed them. I'm having a hard time finding podcasts that aren't boring!"
9146,RIP
9147,"Hello Internet is in indefinite hiatus, but Brady's other Podcast, Unmade, is pretty original and funny."
9148,"Film Reroll is my fucking jam. A while ago I made an [episode guide](https://old.reddit.com/r/filmreroll/comments/tx23j2/updated_film_reroll_episode_guide/) for new listeners, in case anyone wants to know where to start. But really all episodes are great."
9149,"I love their Bill & Ted reroll and relisten to it periodically.

/r/FilmReroll"
9150,I'm very glad you posted the film reroll. It is legitimately the only actual play I enjoy. The chemistry between the players is so good.
9151,Film Reroll is amazing. Personally I loved their John Wick play through where everyone was one of the mob and John Wick was this bogeyman they just heard about via the GM.
9152,Film Reroll is a masterpiece.
9153,"I dream of someday, somehow, getting someone to listen to Summerspell blind."
9154,"The John Wick episode is fucking amazing for the premise alone: they play as the villains- Wick is coming for them, and they have to survive."
9155,"Oh my gods, thank you! 

I have been trying to remember the name of The Film Reroll for ages. Their Homeward Bound series had me in stitches."
9156,"Another great Film Reroll achievement: They successfully ran Memento, a movie where the protagonist Leonard has short term memory loss and so it's told in reverse order so the audience doesn't know what events led up to each scene. They did so by having each session be one-on-one, with the GM and one single player as Leonard, but every time Leonard lost focus, that player's session ended and they would bring in a different player to play the next scene so even they had no idea what had come before. (And then, of course, the sessions aired in reverse order so the audience AND the players were in the dark at any given moment.)

One notable highlight had Leonard finding the One Ring (or some universe-appropriate version of it), but nobody ever figured out what it did because nobody knew he had it."
9157,I discovered the Film Reroll because of a thread like this back in 2018 or so. Has been my favourite podcast ever since.
9158,"Oh no, Ross and Carrie is my comfort podcast. When I don't have anything specific that I want to listen to, I load up Ross and Carrie. They have a huge back catalogue, and most of their episodes aren't related to current events, so you can listen to them any time."
9159,"Seems like youve got some DnD pod recs, and you mention the adventure zone, but not Not Another DnD Podcast? 

Have you given it a listen at all? NADDPOD is still absolutely the GOAT, to me. If you have listened at all, I'd love to hear your thoughts, especially given your other recs for context."
9160,Yes! Love them. Saw their first live show at Tulkon and it was a riot. They are a cool bunch of people I'd love to have a beer with.
9161,"I started this at work. It's so hilarious, thank you for this recommendation !"
9162,This sounds fun.
9163,"This here is 100 percent the right answer. I don't really play ttrpgs anymore, nor am I a big movie buff, but the Film Reroll is the best. Hell, I haven't watched 50% of the movies that they have rerolled but I love them anyways. This has come with with the unusuall effect that I will remember the Reroll version as the canon. Bear hugs!"
9164,"Film Reroll and Oh No Ross and Carrie are two of my favorites too! Both really fantastic podcasts.

I'd also recommend Campaign: Skyjacks (an actual play about sky pirates based loosely on the music of The Decemberists), Cautionary Tales (a series about incidents throughout history and what we can learn from them), and Hard Choices (a really fun and super queer podcast where a panel ranks the fuckability of characters from a given franchise or theme)."
9165,"God the Halloween series Film Reroll did was fantastic. 

Jeff was a goddamn hero"
9166,"Dude(tte), check out Dungeons and Daddies, super fun and silly D&D podcast about 4 ordinary dads that get stuck in the Forgotten realms."
9167,"Huh. I tried to get into Film Reroll, but it does absolutely nothing for me. I guess everyone has different senses of humor..."
9168,"Wow, haven't listened to film reroll in years!"
9169,Omg
9170,"These are great, thank you."
9171,"Love this podcast, I wish they made episodes more often"
9172,"I should give this one another go. I listened to the first couple of episodes a long while back, and while I liked the concept I just didn't get into it."
9173,OMG I TOTALLY FORGOT ABOUT FILM REROLL
9174,"The Film Reroll where they do a Friday the 13th movie but don't tell the players it's Friday the 13th, so they're all just trying to goof around and not taking notice of weird stuff until the murders start, was a lot of fun. Like literally the kid NPC is like ""would you like to see my room full of creepy handmade masks?"" and no one thinks anything is up "
9175,"A bit late but if you like this you really ought to check out Dungeons and Daddies. Same vibe, just as if not funnier"
9176,"The latest 5-part limited series ""Point Blank"" was a really great listen. Fascinating to hear the different experiences of the people involved."
9177,You'll enjoy Radio Rental.
9178,"Came here to say this! Of every podcast I've listened to, this is by far my favorite."
9179,This is currently one of my favorite podcasts. So many intriguing life experiences!
9180,I will have to give this a listen sounds like *Risk!* which is my favorite podcast. People tell their true stories ranging from serious trauma to shitting on the roof of a drug dealer's car. All very worth listening to.
9181,There were definitely some gut wrenching episodes. The one about the guy who found out his girlfriend was pregnant and he was so excited. And then she just ghosted him and gave the kid up for adoption and he longs for the day that he can finally meet his kid. He loves his child so much and has never met it.
9182,"So is it like that show, I Shouldn't Be Alive? I was a sucker for that."
9183,I found this as well and god damn there is some fucked up stories.
9184,This podcast has helped me work through some of my own traumas and not feel so alone. Some of the episodes are really heavy and so I have to take breaks from it sometimes. That bear episode still gets to me to this day.
9185,Same. The episode about the guy who's wife was killed by that bear while they were hiking has always haunted me.
9186,"This is probably the most intense podcast I've listened to. I caught a random episode on the road with my wife and was just like ""holy shit"" the whole time."
9187,"All the trigger warnings for this one. It's really well done, but it's just too intense for me."
9188,"I just discovered this one a couple months ago, and my usual thing with new podcasts is I listen to ALL the back catalog. 

I ended up having to limit how many episodes I'd listen to per day because listening to a bunch of these heart-wrenching, trauma filled episodes all in a row was getting to be too much for me. 

Love it though, it's in my rota now, but consider this a warning about binging too much!"
9189,"Sort of reminds me of the memory palace (name not capitalised), it has a set narrator but it's about a short vignette in time, you don't know what it is going in. Really short episodes but always profound"
9190,Scrolled too long to see this one. Love this podcast
9191,I just started this a few weeks ago and every episode has been blowing me away. It's often gut wrenching but always worth it
9192,I found one similar called (what was that like) same concept and quite enjoyable although some episodes are hard to listen to.
9193,Their current series is five episodes about a single mass shooter event in California. Each episode covers a different person's first hand account.
9194,"I like this is actually happening but lately every episode is a plug for something. Every guest has a podcast, or a book, or s YouTube channel that they are looking to drive clicks for and it's not as raw this way."
9195,This is one of my favorites!
9196,Wow. Thank you for this rec. Going to listen tonight!
9197,Where do they get these stories from? Listeners? Reddit? Historic journals?
9198,A friend of mine was on that podcast! They lost their leg in a medical accident related to Marijuana addiction.
9199,"The woman who joined Scientology and subsequently got out. Whew, that one was intense"
9200,Yes!!
9201,Quality dropped off a cliff once it went to Wondery... where good podcasts go to be slathered in mediocrity.
9202,This is my favorite podcast!!
9203,That one stresses me out so much
9204,I've been binge listening to this one lately. I'll probably go out to my car and listen to another one after typing this
9205,Sounds like This American Life
9206,"One of my favorites!

The dendrologist episode lead me to find my favorite podcast ""Completely Arbortrary"""
9207,"How in the world is this so low?! I've learned so much from those podcast, and she's so relatable and down-to-earth."
9208,"Love Alie! Also, if you like Ologies, don't sleep on Science Vs."
9209,Fact that this isn't higher is a CRIME
9210,I find Oligies a bit hit and miss but some of them are really good. I highly recommend the episode about bleach! I had no idea how interesting the topic of bleach could be and it honestly blew my mind
9211,Obviously it's only about Alex jones and infowars but it's a great analysis about how misinformation spreads in our current world. A+ podcast.
9212,"Knowledge fight is incredible. Well worth a listen. Just dive in anywhere, then once you've got a handle on stuff, listen to the ""formulaic objections"" where the hosts listen to depositions from infowars staff. Amazing stuff"
9213,"I have a specific way I consume media. I have to start it from the beginning. I'm literally hundreds of hours in, and I realized the other day that if I listened to it 4 hours a day every day, it would still take me over a year to get through their catalogue (rough estimate). I have my work cut out for me."
9214,What's your bright spot?
9215,"One of the best. Literally an academic level dive into the world of insane conspiracy theories plus fun...but, what's your bright spot?"
9216,^^Red ^^alert! ^Red ^alert! Red Alert!
9217,RED ALERT
9218,"Worth checking out for the intro song alone, fucking brilliant."
9219,"It inoculates you against conspiracy theories, personality cults, and general political loonacy."
9220,Dan's voice sounds exactly like Obama.
9221,Four stars. Go home to your mother and tell her you're brilliant.
9222,I RENOUNCE JESUS CHRIST!
9223,I second and third this.
9224,I highly recommend ruining your brain and starting from the beginning of that podcast. It's a wild ride. QAnon Anonymous as well.
9225,"""They"" listen to Alex Jones because he is mOsTlY rIgHt, I listen to Alex to hear him ask congressman Ron Paul if we even had any planes in Vietnam. We are not the same."
9226,I unironically think Knowledge Fight is the most important podcast airing today.  The work they're doing is so important
9227,"I mean if you want to lose all faith in humanity and end up in a world of dread 

But seriously a great look at what the lunatic fringe is doing"
9228,"Have you tried Not Your Grandmother's Book Club? It was inspired by KF and the hosts read crappy right-wing books by people like Dinesh D'Souza and Glen Beck. A bit less research and more opinion, but very fun."
9229,Did Squanch ever make it home ?
9230,"""Jar Jar Binks has a Caribbean Black accent""... ""I don't want to hate black people"" - Alex Jones"
9231,The best find of the early pandemic
9232,There we are. Had to scroll a bit but I found the correct answer to OP's question.
9233,Dan is an amazing researcher and is so damn humble about it. I really appreciate how he very consistently hangs back on certain things out of wanting to be avoid being a sensationalistic podcast and stick to his goal. Still manages to have a very entertaining show with Jordan. He acted as a consultant with the lawyers going after Alex Jones!
9234,Here come the sex robots!
9235,I had to stop listening to this podcast because I hate Alex Jones so much. I found myself getting too angry listening to his moronic rants that I just couldn't do it anymore.
9236,"Made sure to read the comments before posting this. I've never felt so knowledgeable about far right media until this podcast. Fuck Alex Jones, and every Nazi, sovereign citizen, qanon member, and snake oil hustler he brings on air.

It's amazing how far back the horrid ideologies of today go. Watching 2002-2003 stuff makes me realize we were ignoring the signs for decades.

The man has a clear and long standing track record of reading headlines (and maybe the first paragraph) and making up the rest to serve his personal beliefs. Thereabouts every mass shooting he's labeled as some form of conspiracy. He does this over and over and over and over.

A broken record that's been on air for 20 years."
9237,"My current favorite. 

My kid thought I had lost my marbles because they heard Alex Jones coming out of the office. I played them an epsidode of Knowledge Fight and they accepted me back as their father."
9238,I genuinely laugh my ass off during this
9239,"Came here to say this! Love, love, love these guys!!"
9240,I'm a policy wonk!
9241,I'm a policy wonk! And I love you
9242,"Scrolled way to far to find this. I was about to post it myself. It's basically the only pod I listen to anymore but it's been less lately since even through the boys, I can only stomach hearing that asshole so much till I need a little breaky"
9243,best podcast intro imo. glad to see this one mentioned!
9244,Especially the Project Camelot and Formulaic Objection episodes. I've listened to each a few times and they still make me laugh.
9245,"I'd consider myself a long time podcast addict - listened to nearly every big podcast in the past decade. 

But since I found Knowledge Fight during the Pandemic, that has consumed probably about 80% of my podcast diet. And I still have thousands of hours to go! 

Way too fucking good"
9246,"I love what they do and I love them as guests on other podcasts... But I just can't sit through the show, it's too long, too poorly mixed and honestly... I don't want to listen to Alex Jones that much. I love them and support the work they do, but I can't bear to listen to it"
9247,Little breaky for me.
9248,My people!
9249,"I came for the Alex Jones tear downs, I stayed for the Raptor Princesses."
9250,It's time to pray
9251,"One of the few themes I genuinely look forward to hearing, absolute genius.

""It's time to pray ..."""
9252,Hell yes love me some Knowledge Fight.
9253,I'm listening to the Formulaic Objection episodes. Pure brilliance.
9254,Go home and tell your mother you're brilliant
9255,Mic down.
9256,"I love the little group.  Conan assembled this team of employees, which is so efficient, rather than just having a second host.  But the dynamic and his playing up of himself as an authoritarian create such a dynamic for the play between them.  It's like intrigue because some of the shit he says is too real, but it's also just this factory for bits because *it's really a workplace comedy*.  

to me, the interviews are secondary and really just help to facilitate the existing ensemble.  I LOOOOOOOOVE it when Sona and Matt are bigger parts of the interviews.  Conan's ability to play is what makes him a superstar and this podcast is near total freedom from studio surveillance."
9257,"I started out only listening to the celebrities that interested me but then realized that Conan is such a great interviewer he can make almost anyone interesting, so I went back and listened to them all. This is my top comedy podcast, I can't find anything that even compares."
9258,"I've been a Conan fan for decades, but this podcast really demonstrates the full agility of his unique, brilliant mind. His interviews are thoughtful and insightful, and his curiosity takes conversations to unexpected places.

But for me, the true gold is found in the intros and the outros. His ability to craft a bit on virtually any setup is unmatched. He once riffed as Richard Nixon resigning Presidency, not due to Watergate but because he'd taken role in Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo. I'm not sure I've laughed harder at anything in the last 10 years. The podcast has solidified him for me as the sharpest comedy mind today."
9259,"I already loved him because of his late-night stint(s) but hearing him talk to people for a longer period of time made me appreciate his humor, wit, and intelligence even more! 

The episode with Stephen Colbert is my absolute favorite but for all-time laughs the ones with Timothy Olyphant, Tig Notaro, Bob Newhart and Kevin Nealon are my go-tos."
9260,Both Kevin Nealon episodes are the most chaotic but at the same time beautiful things I have ever heard
9261,I see no call outs for Tracy Morgan. Those two are fire together!  Joop!
9262,"This is my favourite comedy one too.

Paul Rudd's first episode where he and Conan do the bit about cooking chicken breasts genuinely made me cry with laughter."
9263,"The Conan O'Brien Needs a Fan episodes are just as good, sometimes better, than the celebrity guest episodes. The fans sometimes catch Conan completely off guard and his reactions are priceless."
9264,"I came here to make sure this was mentioned. Conan O'Brien is, in my opinion, the funniest human alive. But he also is insightful, and his interactions with literally anyone are always enjoyable. It's why I also love the spin-off podcast where he interviews fans all over the world."
9265,Kedakai! As god made her!
9266,the Adam Sandler episode filled me with sympathy and appreciation I did not know I possessed
9267,This got me through COVID
9268,"The Kevin Nealon trainwrecks are what got me listening, and I was hooked immediately. I've been making my way through the backlog ever since."
9269,Thst time Paul Rudd did his Mac And Me joke on his podcast was absolutely brilliant. A visual joke on an audio medium was just something else. Had me dying of laughter.
9270,This is my happy place.
9271,I have the Bob Newhart episode saved because it's just SO good. What a gift!
9272,The guy who invented podcasting?
9273,"Special mention to some of his guests - Martin short, Timothy olyphant, Jeff goldblum and Kevin Nealon who really have some of the best episodes. If you've been following conan's talk show career you'll be able to spot who already has good chemistry with conan  

Edit: I like the ones with Michelle and Barack Obama too"
9274,I think it's definitely one of the best comedy/interview podcasts made right now
9275,His podcast is mainly him and Sona fighting and it's glorious
9276,"He has saved me from some very dark times, I appreciate him so much and he will never know."
9277,Seeing Conan as back to back answers reminded me how much I loved it when it first got going. Need to make a return bc I couldn't agree w/ you more.
9278,I was going to add this to my list because I keep seeing so many clips off it on YouTube that are hilarious.
9279,Shazzzzzzzzz
9280,The Dana Carvey deep dive 6 partner is some of the funniest shit I ever heard
9281,"Yup. Conan is a great interviewer, probably because he is phenomenal at comedic improve. He's able to go off the cuff and bounce wild shit into the guests court, then you end up with some great responses.

Plus Matt and Sona both bring a special sauce. Their bits at the begging and end of shows are great"
9282,The episode with Flula Borg I was driving with a friend and I nearly had to pull over because I was laughing so hard.
9283,I love all the episodes with comedic legends but weirdly my favorite is the one with Charles Barkley. Conan's quick wit and self deprecating sarcasm is unmatched. He has a great ability to let his guests shine and pick up on their lead. This is a great podcast and never fails to make me laugh.
9284,"I absolutely ruined podcasts for myself by listening to this first. Then I tried other comedy podcasts thinking they would be on par.. smh. Conan has a gift for empathy, humor, humility (with his guests only) and intellect that are unmatched. The only other things I like are some things on Team Coco like Nicole Byers"
9285,His best jokes were born in that podcast. I watch the bit where he makes up Taylor Swift songs and albums and I lose it every time
9286,His interview with Charles Barkley killed me. Great podcast.
9287,"I heard COB on a BBC podcast ""The Infinite Monkey Cage"" which will talk about science stuff with a panel. The panel will typically be two or three scientists, and an entertainer who is straight out of left field. Imagine 2 geologists, a volcanologist, and a rock singer who blew up high school science lab. Works better than you would imagine. 

One episode this year, they went to the JPL, and had a couple of serious eggheads and... Conan O'Brien. His total contribution was to say silly things about science that weren't quite on topic. Oddly, everything he said set off the two scientists to tell about fascinating stuff. Some of the stories the scientists told, I don't think they had ever told. I went from thinking, ""Geez, this guy is cringe,"" to ""Dang, he's good.""

The two hosts (who are actually really good at this) did the introduction and the closing, and kept out of the way. It may have been the best show in the series."
9288,"I love Conan, I think he's genuinely one of the best people and funniest personalities in television, and I love the podcast.

*But* it's one that I reach a saturation point for relatively quickly.  Something about Conan's humor, when I've had my fill of it, I really need to step away.  It makes it hard for me to catch up on when I've been away from it for a while, but I always do catch up eventually."
9289,I only wish the interviews would be a bit longer and more impromptu. But it's great to still get content with Conan.
9290,They have a channel on XM radio that plays this 24/7 and I have it on in my car most of the time.  I love it.
9291,Hes so damn good. Under appreciated for sure
9292,r/conan
9293,"I love the Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend episodes, but I've found myself loving the Conan O'Brien Needs a Fan episodes even more.  I feel like the completely unknown guests and the way Conan gets to know them really just shows off his genius more than the celebrity episodes."
9294,Nice I'm glad I saw a more popular comment than mine praising this podcast. It's such an easy listen when nothing else sounds good and I need noise in my head.
9295,The episode where he and Paul Rudd riff for like 5 minutes making creepy noises made me snort milk
9296,I love Conan but am I the only one who thinks that podcast is too much sometimes? There's so much forced laughing from Conan and Sona
9297,"This podcast got me through COVID lockdowns and beyond.

There's an episode with Anthony Anderson where he talks about beating Michael Jordan at dominoes that I go to anytime I need a good laugh. I think that same episode Deon Cole calls in and crashes the podcast too."
9298,Great podcast! And knowing Conan plays guitar isn't the intro him playing?
9299,"I used to love that show, but stopped listening when they started advertising for gambling sponsors.  Fuck anyone that rich who will take the money from such predatory groups just to get richer."
9300,"On a needs a fan episode they were talking to someone from Vulcan, Alberta as I was driving through the town and I gotta say it was actually one of the creepiest things I've ever experienced. The odds were miniscule."
9301,On that note matt gourley podcasts. I love he andy daly podcast project and superego.
9302,Omg I love it
9303,It made me realize how much of early Simpson is directly from him.
9304,"This ones my go to podcast when opening up the app, for sure. Gotta get my serotonin levels up for the other ones."
9305,"I absolutely love this one - listen to every episode and find myself enjoying Matt & Sona (sp?) nearly as much as Conan and his guests. 

All good dynamics on the show which I find to be pretty rare."
9306,Love this. My all-time favorite episode is with Tig Notaro and the clown nose noises.
9307,The one with Jeff Goldbloom is amazing
9308,Sona is so so funny too!
9309,Such a good podcast. Flula Borg is brilliant chaotic genius.
9310,"KEDAKAI!!!  
as God made her"
9311,The Timothy Olyphant and Jeff Goldblum episodes legit had me crying laughing.
9312,One of my favorites! Grew up sneaking past my bedtime to watch him. His humor is the perfect combo of intelligent and childish and he's one of the best interviewers out there. Gourley and Sona are fantastic co-hosts as well.
9313,"His interview with Kevin Nealon made me laugh so hard I peed a little.

https://youtu.be/9myNYPA3Z5Q"
9314,I listen now and again. The self-deprecation gets a bit tiring as a form of comedy. But I do enjoy some of the guests.
9315,I'm deeply appreciate of his insights into the emotional burden that comes with being an Irish Catholic from New England
9316,The Kevin Nealon episodes are just electric
9317,So a drives me crazy but otherwise it's pretty great
9318,"Am I the only one who skips the first 10 minutes of celebrity interviews? I don't care about Sonia and that other guy. Just start the show and let the riffing begin. 

Also his team definitely edits in laughs from time to time. Once you hear it you will never unhear it"
9319,I was really into this for about 3 years but sometime around last Halloween or so I just completely lost interest in haven't been back since
9320,"Conan freaks me out, he looks like that piano guy from Courage the Cowardly Dog"
9321,Yes! Came here to post this one. I need more podcasts like this to balance out all the murder/occult/dark history stuff
9322,"Man, what a twist. 

While I thought this episode was slow, I did enjoy the reveal for the HOA/catnip ep. That was slow burn revenge"
9323,"The girls trip one, that was GRIPPING. Also omg the coffee shop one!!"
9324,"I only found out about this one in the last month or so and listened to every episode! Didn't realize I'd like it so much, and happy the new season started."
9325,Yes!!! The hot dog in the toilet story makes me laugh every time I listen to it. So glad they're back for another season!!
9326,I just finished the one where the lady ran the knitting circle and went viral using acrylic wool after giving the main character shit for not using real wool. So funny.
9327,SQUIRREL STORY!
9328,Grandma's Best Friend Dot and the Short King of East Texas are just sooo good.
9329,Normal gossip is so good but I have to fast forward to the main story every episode. I don't care about hearing the guest's relationship with gossip.
9330,Glad to see this up here. Such a great podcast and there is a new episode today.
9331,I was screaming in my car when they got to the end of the squirrel story!
9332,That sounds like Gossipmongers
9333,"Love this podcast so much, the premise is just brilliant"
9334,"Yes Normal Gossip! So glad it's back for season 4 finally.
If you like Normal Gossip...
Break-up Breakdown - breakup drama
The Secret Room - people share their secrets, usually pretty fascinating
Please Don't Tell Anyone - similar to the secret room 
Heavyweight - each episode unpacks an interpersonal mystery"
9335,"I listen to podcasts almost exclusively audio only, but I always watch the Fall of Civilizations videos when they are released. It adds an extra level of immersion and they are so well done. The quality is on par or even surpasses most history documentaries out there."
9336,"> Fall of Civilizations

New episode on Carthage just came out."
9337,Cautionary Tales is genuinely the best podcast around. The first season especially.
9338,"Came here to say Fall of Civilizations. I'm not even a podcast person, but I love the YouTube videos. It's a very lovely experience all around."
9339,Why did it take this long to see Cautionary Tales listed?   Maybe one of my all time favorite podcasts!
9340,Cautionary Tales with Harford?
9341,"Cautionary tales is a great podcast, I really enjoyed the futility closet as well"
9342,"Fall of civilisation podcast really goes hard. 

Like listen to the Sumerians and Assyrian episode then go to the Louvre, British Museum or similar and it totally changes your view on just how good and meaningful the exhibits are.

Hammurabi law code Stellite. Amazing

Ea Nasir Copper Complaint. Fantastic

My wife waiting for my to finish gawking at clay tablets. Annoyed "
9343,The Rapa Nui one nearly brought me to tears. Amazing episode. Humanity are a bunch of bastards at times.
9344,"Eek!!  Thanks for the update!  When I saw your update, I immediately went to confirm and it's there!!  LOVE fall of civilizations!!!"
9345,"God, that was far further down the list than I imagined. This podcast is extremely good and atmospheric. The sound production there is just pristine."
9346,I had to scroll way too long to find Fall of Civilizations - Paul Cooper is fantastic
9347,Two of my favourites!
9348,I really like Ear Hustle! Nigel and Earlonne have such great chemistry and they're so good at bringing out stories in people.
9349,This needs to be up higher. So well produced and tells great stories that help humanize people that a lot of us are content to treat as animals.
9350,One of the things I love about ear hustle is how it makes me grateful for mundane every day things. Very grounding.
9351,"Such a great show that provides insight into a world I'm almost fully divested from in my personal life. I've been listening since season one and not going to lie, I shed a tear when Jerry Brown commuted Earlonne's life sentence."
9352,This is one of my favorites as well!
9353,I like to tell people that this podcast is so good that they released the cohost from prison early. Which is true!
9354,Definitely one of my favorites!
9355,"Yesss it is so well done, they are such good hosts and they tell these stories so well."
9356,"I've been hooked on this lately. Great hosts and great stories! Some are brutal tho. The whole 3 strikes (3 crimes) and you are stuck in there for life, Jesus... That episode especially got to me. You listen and wonder how many times can life fuck over this man. He was writing journal to her daughter to let her know that he loves her and that it's not her fault, even though there is no way for him to ever find her, but he keeps writing for years, just to unload the sadness that he's caring. Then by some incredible movie-worthy coincidence that lady happens to live minutes from her, my god, it just broke me..."
9357,Agree!
9358,I used to work with Chuck's wife in her soap shop!
9359,"[The End of the World with Josh Clarke](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-end-of-the-world-with-josh-clark/id1437682381) is also by the guy from SYSK. Great listen, and I feel the format is better than SYSK as it's a lot less rambling and back and forth."
9360,"I used to really like them, until they covered topics/fields that I do know well, and it's painfully clear how non-well researched their content is, and how many major gaps are skipped over or ignored "
9361,What is it about?
9362,"I mean,  they probably don't know that's why they are asking. /s"
9363,"Damn, I started listening to them in 2009 when they were at the top of the very new podcasting scene and I was a middle schooler that needed something to fall asleep to. 14 years later and it's a pavlovian response where I pass the fuck out when I hear josh and chuck."
9364,I love SYSK. Especially love listening to then on a long drive.
9365,Stuff they don't want you to know
9366,I'm convinced Jerry isn't real
9367,What are your favorite episodes from this? It's on my list but I get overwhelmed with the choices haha
9368,[deleted]
9369,Followed by Stuff They Don't Want You to Know
9370,Best one!
9371,Definitely worth it
9372,Excellent sleepy time podcast
9373,Stuff they don't want you to know. Also good
9374,"Sometimes I feel like it's lacking and ""Ologies"" is AMAZING. It's a better version in some aspects and enjoyed it so much. I think SYSK is good, Ologies was just a smidge better for me (If you can find a topic you really like or wanna learn about)"
9375,"It's a good podcast, but one of the guys voices is so soothing that I almost started dozing off while driving one time. Still absolutely worth a listen!"
9376,SYSK is great! I usually listen to some on road trips.
9377,Surprised this was so far down. Came here to find this.
9378,It's fun until they talk about a topic you're an expert in and realize they know nothing and don't even research correctly
9379,"I've tried so many times to get into this podcast, but for some reason I just can't. I don't know why, but I cannot stand it. I really wish I liked it, they talk about a lot of interesting stuff."
9380,Came here to say this. The OG podcast. The podcast of podcasts
9381,Really enlightening on the pots and pans industry.
9382,"""Her nipples stood out like the three-inch rivets on the ill-fated Titanic."""
9383,"""He _grabbed_ her cervix""

Alice's reaction to that line is an all time hilarious moment"
9384,"""oh calm down Belinda, not everybody wants a shag!""

First time I heard that I laughed uproariously for about 5 minutes straight."
9385,"I have pulled off the road listening to this because I couldn't drive anymore, due to the crying/laughing."
9386,"This is, hands down, the funniest podcast ever."
9387,"I'll NEVER not cry laughing when James talks about the cat saying hello to him.

Oooh oooh, or when the duchess screams to the rescue ""DID SOMEBODY SAY..........COCK?????"".

God damn, I wish there was more.  I know Rocky has carried on but it's not the same :("
9388,"This might be a controversial opinion but I felt the show took a bit of a dive once Rocky's ""original"" novels were done and they moved on to the books he wrote after the show started/became popular. It just wasn't as funny when Rocky was clearly leaning into the weird/unconventional stuff that made the show funny versus the original novels written by someone who seems to have zero knowledge of sex."
9389,"My favorite moments include: blue cheese fish mousse, anything involving Toffee Apple Chew, and anything involving Bella "
9390,"I have gone from scream laughing with tears streaming down my face to yelling, ""EW EW EW!"" within a span of 10 seconds listening to that podcast."
9391,Hallo
9392,Little finger laugh at you
9393,This made me the laughing lady on the subway... Belinda blinked...
9394,Can I just skip to a certain season or do I need to watch from the start dude?
9395,"""Belinda touched a humid penis."""
9396,Checking it out now!
9397,"In case anyone is wondering how good this podcast is, I've listened to the entirety of it like, five times. Literally the funniest thing ever."
9398,"r/mydadwroteaporno

Also, *gentleman woof*"
9399,It was the skin sloughing off the penis enlargement that did me in: Disgusted laughter.
9400,"My absolute favorite podcast, and I've listened from the beginning multiple times;"
9401,Love this one! We are now introducing it to our older children and laughing our asses off again
9402,"For real, the pausing due to too much laughing is real"
9403,I great podcast for those wanting to learn more about business
9404,"Every time Alice has to stop and explain why what Rocky wrote is physically impossible or Alice and James asking Jamie if he is adopted literally has me in tears from laughing so hard.

""Belinda pulled him over to the bed and started to stimulate his monster dick with her hand. As she did so, some of the skin fell to the ground."" Poetry."
9405,"Named my cat after a character from the podcast. That podcast is freaking hilarious
Edit: Her name is Penelope Pollet, for those of you who are asking"
9406,"This podcast has killed sex scenes in books for me. I was recently reading a book that described eating a woman out as ""a feast"" and all I could hear was Jamie doing the Duchess'(?) ""Let me have my FEAST"" voice and couldn't stop laughing through what was supposed to be a very pivotal/serious scene in the book."
9407,"""That's your DAD, Jaime!"""
9408,My favorite thing about MDWAP is that the plot is so bananas that I can go back to old episodes and it's like I'm hearing them for the first time. Every episode surprises every time.
9409,Jim Stirling's character arc was really..... something.
9410,Oh hi Belinda!
9411,First time i listened I was utterly in tears laughing
9412,it's got a pretty active subreddit too. Rocky visits often.
9413,You'll never see pomegranates the same way again.
9414,Best podcast ever. I literally laugh out loud every single episode.
9415,What is it about?
9416,"I have never laughed so hard - like so hard I'm silent laughing and tears are streaming hard.  I saw my coworker listening on earbuds doing this and had to ask her WTF it was.

99% of what makes this great are the voices, banter, and snide remarks, although the books have their moments!"
9417,r/nocontext
9418,"I was having one of those checkups women have with a midwife when your legs are akimbo and I was like ""oh I might listen to a podcast"" and she just goes ""my dad wrote a porno"" which ensued a lot of laughter until she explained, I still need to give it a listen."
9419,"Oh my god, I've never laughed so hard in my life. I'm a pretty reserved dude and I found myself scream laughing into a pillow on a long flight."
9420,"I tried to start this one, but I usually listen to podcasts in the car. And it just feels sort of awkward listening to a porno being read to me. Especially since sometimes people can hear a bit of what you're listening to as you drive "
9421,Criminal is one of the best to be sure. And Phoebe's voice is perfect
9422,"I've listened to every single episode and am almost through This is Love. Now I'm starting ""Phoebe reads a mystery"" just to get my fix of Phoebe's voice."

9424,But please.. no packages. We don't trust you.
9425,Swindled is so fucking good. The production is impeccable
9426,"In the same vein, Scam Goddess. Hosted by a comedian and guests, it's delightful."
9427,Swindled is great
9428,I too am a concerned citizen. Swindled is my absolute favorite. The Octopus and The Hero are a few of my favorite episodes.
9429,"Do you also love the host's presentation? He likes to read comments about his voice, which I find hilarious. The very dry humor, the quiet voice - they just make the subject even more interesting. 
I'm still blown away by the Horse Queen. How a woman managed to swindle a small town out of that much money....."
9430,"Scamfluences is similar, but slightly less sinister if you like the type of things covered. I'm almost through the backlog of swindled so was glad to find something else!"
9431,You'd probably like Queen of the Con.
9432,Disappointing that I had to collapse this many replies to see this answer. This podcast deserves more attention.
9433,I love this show!!!
9434,"This podcast is so underrated. Hands down one of the top five, and astonishingly consistent."
9435,"I like Swindled as well! If you're into Swindled, check out Profiteers vs. The People. It's way more lighthearted, but I feel like the subject matter is similar"
9436,if that rocks you then give Criminal by Phoebe Judge a shot.
9437,Love this podcast!
9438,you might enjoy Lie Cheat & Steal which is about con artists and frauds
9439,"Downloaded this recently, haven't been in my car long enough to get to it!"
9440,"It's fun but very true ""crimey."" Less ""her legs were cut off, her head was cut off"" but enjoyable."
9441,"You might like Scamfluencers, too!"
9442,I love it too! The monotony of his voice is such a turn on.
9443,They do a lottery ball machine and have for years on that pod right? Surely everyone on the show has gotten it by now?

9449,For John Green fans - The Anthropocene Reviewed is absolutely beautiful. John reviews facets of the human experience on a 5 star scale... From Indianapolis to Canada Geese to Diet Dr Pepper.
9450,Atlas Obscura and 99% invisible are awesome
9451,"Given what you listed, you probably already listened to this, but in case anyone else hasn't: the American Ivy season of **Articles of Interest** (a spinoff from 99% Invisible) is phenomenal. 

Also you've got great taste. Dear Hank and John, 99PI, and Atlas Obscura are my three nonfiction mainstays."
9452,Love Roman Mars' voice.... perfect for podcasting!
9453,You'd probably like Cautionary Tales then
9454,Dork Forest! Jackie Kashian is an underrated star
9455,Podcasts about death are my favorite! DFTBA
9456,"Just want to shout out ""Our Fake History"". Delves into history and myth, trying to separate the truth from the fiction. Super interesting!"
9457,"Dork Forest is great because it's very specifically positive. When you need to feel good you can listen to someone explain why they love something. Good episodes are Todd Glass on table settings, Greg Proops and baseball, or Chris Titus talking about Prince."
9458,Every Monday there isn't a new John and Hank I die a little inside
9459,"Anyone who loves 99PI and wants something similar, look into Radiolab!"
9460,"I listen to a lot of podcasts, and I think 99% Invisible has been consistently the best pod in my feed for about 10 years."
9461,How did I have to scroll so far to find 99% Invisible. Incredible reporting on every aspect of the designed and built world around us.
9462,"It could just be me, but I feel like if you enjoy the Green brothers you may also enjoy *My Brother, My Brother, and Me.*"
9463,Pumpkins and penguins
9464,I just started listening to Dork Forest and 99% Invisible. A second your recommendations!
9465,Jackie from The Dork Forest also has another podcast with Laurie Kilmartin that's very good
9466,Sci show tangents with Hank Green is also amazing
9467,99pi was one of the first podcasts I listened to. Roman Mars has a great voice
9468,Atlas Obscura also has a website that shows eccentric and interesting places near you
9469,The atlas obscura YouTube channel used to be really awesome as well. Haven't checked it out in a bit though.
9470,"A little self promotion here, but given your taste in random topics you might like our show .. History Happened Everywhere .. a light entertainment show where each episode we take a random time, place and topic to tell interesting and unexpected stories from history. I'd love to know how we compare against your favourites!"
9471,Shout to the rangers of the dork forest
9472,The History Chicks is also a great podcast about women in history!
9473,I fucking love the way you formatted this.
9474,"99% Invisible was probably my favourite podcast until the takeover. There was a dive in quality for a while, but might be back to its good old self again now, I dunno."
9475,">ExploreAStory  
>  
> \- podcast on museums, science and storytelling.

I can't seem to find this one on my podcast app (PocketCasts) or on google. Could it have a different name? It sounds really interesting."
9476,I would rather eat glass than listen to hank green
9477,The Greg Davies Christmas episode was genuinely unhinged.
9478,"This! It sounds like such a random premise, but Ed and James are really good and the conversations they gave with the guests are so diverse."
9479,The episode with Richard Ayoade is absolutely hilarious
9480,[deleted]
9481,"Similarly, Films to Be Buried With.  It's hosted by Brett Goldstein (Roy Kent from Ted Lasso) and he interviews guests by asking them about notable films in their life (film that scared them the most, film they love but everyone else hates, film they had a memorable experience seeing, etc.)  It's funny and always so insightful about the guest, and Brett is an absolute delight who clearly *loves* talking about movies."
9482,"Yeah this isn't bad, the one with Dan Aykroyd is gold, they don't get a word in. James just managed to get in a ""popadom or bread"" once it's all ended, and Dan goes off on another tangent describing the whole Indian type meal that he'd serve.

9483,"That was also my answer (along with the Taskmaster podcast and Perfect Sounds-I like Acaster and Gamble, what can I say!)

I do think (and mentioned in my answer) that the show is (unfortunately) dropping in quality and OP should concentrate on the earlier seasons if they want to give it a listen."
9484,Papadams or bread ?!?
9485,"I was skeptical of this because I think the premise is kind of dull, and would lend itself to a lot of self-indulgence. But I love the hosts and all things Taskmaster-adjacent so I gave it a try.

It's really genuinely funny and has a lot of great conversations. Sometimes you'll even learn about a new dish you want to try. 

\\The quality really depends on the guests, but it's one of my favorite discoveries of 2023."
9486,Papadams or Bread!
9487,"Plus, there's a genie!"
9488,"This is my answer, seriously gets me crying with laughter"
9489,"> James Acaster

Sold!"
9490,I loved the idea but I got tired of the celebs. Same issue with the Conan O'Brien Needs A Friend podcast. Couldn't stand listening to the celeb guests after a while.
9491,"I used to love this and while James Acaster is a national treasure, Ed Gamble is so annoying to me now that I can't get through a full episode, which is a crying shame."
9492,Sounds fucking awful.
9493,"I felt this was overly promoted, saw adverts for it everywhere so avoided it as it felt too corporate and forced, I've still never even given it a chance."
9494,This is a great one and I've listened to nearly all their episodes. Everything they talk about is fascinating.
9495,"When we say semi-serious: it is well researched and as factual as the hosts can make it. There's lots of goofs and jokes, but the way it's structured is that the husband(Justin McElroy) plays up being stupid and ignorant for laughs, and often deliberately misinterprets what his wife says. So it does a good job of making jokes without confusing what is true and what is not."
9496,Glad one of the McElroy podcasts are at the top. Saw bones is so good.
9497,"I found the quality has trailed off over the last couple years so I've stopped listening to it. There's a big enough backlog that it's still worth getting into.

Bedside Rounds is another good medical podcast but it's a bit less layman/comedy focussed."
9498,"Everytime I get sick at all, I think about having to eat ground up mummies bc of this podcast"
9499,"Yesss, Sawbones is the only podcast that has me paying attention the whole time. I feel like I could listen to Sydnee and Justin just talk about anything and be entranced tbh"
9500,I found this a fee months ago and obsessively binged all of it. I was then sad when I was caught up and had to actually wait and listen once a week. It was so perfect to listen to when doing chores around the house or being bored at work.
9501,"I liked the first bunch of it, but I think they kind of ran out of the really dumb treatments.

If y'all want another good medical podcast, check out This Podcast Will Kill You, in which 2 epidemiologists cover a different disease each episode, telling you what it will physically do in your body, how you get it, the history of it, and how worried you should be about it now. The hosts (both named Erin) are the biggest geeks about the stuff that it's a lot of fun."
9502,Basically and of the McElroy Family stuff is pretty worth it. At the very least season 1 of The Adventure Zone is a work of art and the OG My Brother My Brother and Me always cheers me up.
9503,Zeke Teenweed approves of this message
9504,You best be making an edit to add in mbmbam into your comment or the glass shark is gonna get you.
9505,"Their early episodes are great. The Man Behind the Knick is a particular standout.

But I feel like they've kind of run out of all the good kooky medical history, and it's become a lot more... political(?) since COVID. I'm generally aligned with their positions, but it hasn't felt like the same podcast for a while."
9506,"It's also pretty kid friendly (topic depending), my kiddo loves listening to sawbones"
9507,Loooove sawbones. I fall asleep to old episodes some nights.
9508,This is the podcast that got me into podcasts. Still a favourite almost 10 years later.
9509,"Been listening to MBMBAM for years and never actually picked up Sawbones, I should really check it out"
9510,"Wooh, Sawbones is great! It's fascinating and usually has just enough humor to keep things light."
9511,I'm really surprised to not see My Brother My Brother and Me higher up on the list. I haven't seen it mentioned at all outside this comment
9512,"I was originally annoyed at this pod, because it's basically one of them talking about actually important and interesting medical history while the other host who doesn't know anything just riffs on it. But it's kind of endearing"
9513,"So, that is what Justin is... only been following him since Joysiq and never laughed once."
9514,"Damn I really want to like this one. I've tried some random eps, but can't get past the 45 minutes of ""listen to what our toddler did today"" 

Tbf, this was a few years ago, maybe now they're talking about what their 10 year old did today"
9515,"This is the only podcast I listen to regularly. My favourite is the tagline for I think part 3 of the Battle of Kursk: ""SS Soldiers chant 'Lunch in Kursk, lunch in Kursk!' They would not, in fact, be having lunch in Kursk."""
9516,100%- we're all gonna have jobs at the Kandahar Dick Sucking Factory
9517,"This podcast's episodes on the soviet/russian military history has made me realize that russia (among many other nations) never learn... 

The series about the soviet/afghan war was like deja vu for lots of the shit going on in the current russian/ukranian war. 

The Voyage of The Damned and The Winter War are two other great series in the podcast."
9518,"I've started working ""connected him to God's Wi-Fi"" and ""the grand unified theory of Fuck That Guy"" into my daily lexicon"
9519,"Best podcast, hands down. I'm subbed on patreon and ive listened to every episode. Joe is amazing at what he does."
9520,"Should I give this a second chance? I fell off a year or two ago after listening a ton because his guests really sucked (sounded uninterested, their jokes were like ""gErMaNs aRe AlL nAzIs"", they didn't add anything to the conversation)"
9521,"Big fan of Liam's absence lately, much more enjoyable"
9522,K
9523,This is a podcast about filmographies! Directors who have massive success early on in their careers and are given a series of blank checks to make whatever crazy passion project they like. Sometimes those checks clear and sometimes they bounce........bay-bee.
9524,[deleted]
9525,"The Doughboys episode with Nicole Byer and John Hodgman live, reviewing Regina Pizzeria from Boston is definitely in my top 5 episodes of any podcast ever."
9526,"Took a lot of scrolling to see blank check! I started from the beginning and it gave me a reason to watch a lot of films I would otherwise skip or not even know about.


Except the prequels. Still haven't seen them, but still listened to hours of analysis"
9527,Everybody is still recovering from Munch Madness this year
9528,"Two great pods, I knew someone would post these two. Doughboys is the only podcast I've binged from start to end, and I eagerly await the main pod and the Patreon Double episode each week.

I can't get enough of Nick and Mitch!"
9529,"HOWDY HO to Spoon Nation

Emma, let's hit them with a little drop"
9530,"Love Nick's other podcast, Get Played. My favorite podcast for the past year"
9531,"For Blank Check fans, This Had Oscar Buzz is also a delight."
9532,"Blank Check is the only movie podcast that has actually held my interest. Tried Doug Loves Movies, How Did This Get Made, maybe a couple more and they were either boring or just got old. These guys clearly love their subject matter even when it's terrible, are knowledgeable and prepared, just insidery enough to be interesting without getting bogged down in name dropping, and while it's a funny show, they're not there to make jokes or poke fun at the films.  Unless they really deserve it anyway."
9533,"Nick also hosts a gaming podcast called ""Get Played"" its also fantastic!"
9534,Wow.
9535,Spoon Nation represent!
9536,*chef's kiss*
9537,"The fact that dougnboys isnt the first answer in this thread gets me madder than oven fries, not quite crispy enough."
9538,My brother is obsessed with Doughboys.
9539,"Blank Check is when I had the moment of ""I found my people."" For newbies, try ""Mars Attacks!"" with Paul F. Tompkins for a good entry point - they talk about Tim Burton's career without getting too inside joke heavy but is still funny with PFT onboard."
9540,Did you know one of the Blank Check hosts grew up in England?
9541,"I wanted to like Doughboys so bad but I couldn't get over how cynical and angry Mitch came off as, it really turned me off of the show  ):"
9542,"Ologies is a ton of fun. As I imagine many listeners do, I really like the host Alie Ward. She's delightfully nerdy, open, honest, and kind. The pod itself is well structured with useful and interesting asides where Alie adds info among parts of the interview. It's a great way to be entertained while learning about somebody's cool sciency job."
9543,Finally Dungeons and Daddies was mentioned. It literally ruined all other d&d podcasts for me bc it's so good lmao
9544,"The Magnus Archives were great, I binged the whole thing though not sure if they kept going after the main story ended."
9545,Scrolled for Dungeons and Daddies. So good!
9546,TMA is pretty much the only media I've consumed where I was like 'yeah I *should* have checked the content warning for that episode'.
9547,The Magnus Archives is too far down in this thread. Everybody is all over ver serious non-fiction shit.
9548,The Magnus Archives is incredible -- one of the best horror podcasts and I love that the story is finished too.
9549,Surprised that Ologies was this far down the list. I love it!!!
9550,Vouch for TMA
9551,"Not Another D&D Podcast, I will fight you over it."
9552,Not a BDSM podcast!
9553,"Man, scrolled too long for Heavyweight"
9554,Ologies is the GOAT. I will die on this hill.
9555,"Ologies with Alie Ward really is great.

Eclectic, lighthearted, and educational!"
9556,"> Ologies

She is the woman who voices the Kroger ads and no amount of misinformation online will convince me otherwise.

Edit: apparently it is her, lol. I swear last time I checked the credit was for someone else."
9557,"If you're looking for another DnD podcast that is equally unhinged as DnDads, check out Rude Tales of Magic!"
9558,"Can we roll for dankness 


That's a Nat 20 


Literally the dankest shit ever 

Dungeons and daddies is amazing"
9559,"Came here to say ologies with Allie ward, love that one, just wished there were more than one episode a week, I dislike waiting in antici.......pation"
9560,"This is a little niche, but people who like Dungeons and Daddies would also probably like This Game is Broken. It's a board game comedy panel show, it's the only thing that has made me laugh at work while listening to it."
9561,"Ologies by Alie Ward is one of the best podcasts out there, glad to see it listed"
9562,Upvote for The Magnus Archives
9563,the magnus archives my beloved <3
9564,The Magnus Archives is incredible
9565,Heavyweight is fantastic and the COVID check in episodes renewed my love of The Weakerthans.
9566,"*HEAVY WEIGHT -* Have been brought to tears many times from this damn podcast. It is **THE** best.

The lost photograph from the first date when the wife shares her husbands memory of the father rubbing his back...instant waterfalls. God damn."
9567,Dungeons and Daddies made a D&D fan out of me.
9568,Dungeons and daddies is the best podcast ive ever listened to
9569,I'm shocked Dungeons and Daddies is so far down the list!  It's my all time favourite podcast and so much work is put in by the group that it's just a delight to listen to.  Not to mention it also has some of the funniest moments and has 100% made me cry-laugh multiple times.
9570,"Ologies is the podcast that got me into podcasts. Alie has such a great personality and is so good at engaging her listeners. I always listen to each episode, even if it's not something I'll expect to find interesting, and I've been pleasantly surprised many times."
9571,"Oh man I forget how much I like heavy weights till I remember it's on my Spotify and listen.


Ologies is the one I try and force onto everyone lol. Everytime I take a road trip my roommate has to listen to a bazillion facts about the most random parts I found fascinating."
9572,Thank God I saw dungeons and daddies. Another good one is greeting adventurers. It's a home brew campaign with mostly people who haven't played DND alot including the dm so the first 50 or so episodes are a bit rough but it turns into gold after that. I've laughed so hard at both
9573,I went podcast crazy and heavyweight was one I listened to but eventually dropped as the podcast fatigue set in. And really good recent episodes?
9574,I loved heavyweight. I believe it was the first episode when he does it on his dad and uncle falling out and getting older... That shit made me want to slap my uncle and aunts that don't get on and tell them to put their egos aside
9575,Heavyweight kills me. Just the dry humor cracks me up big time.
9576,"Lots of good stuff here, I second both Magnus and D&Dads!"
9577,Oh HEAVYWEIGHT. Incredible.
9578,"Had to scroll way too far for The Magnus Archives. I've listened to several popular horror podcasts (White Vault, Black Tapes, The Sheridan Tapes) and The Magnus Archives is far better than any of those.

It's audio only of course, so the horror doesn't tend to actually be *scary*, but I don't listen to it to be afraid. There are 5 seasons of 40 episodes each, and each season reveals a little more about the world. At the start the main character is just a guy with an archiving job where he has to read people's ""statements"" into a tape recorder. By the end, without spoiling too much, there is a dense web of interconnected story and characters and events that took multiple listens for me to catch onto everything.

Anyone that's looking for a horror podcast, listen to The Magnus Archives. Check out those other ones I mentioned later if you want, but I have not found a horror podcast anywhere close to the level of quality of TMA."
9579,You're Wrong About is fantastic. You *might* like Maintenance Phase (like YWA but focused on diet and wellness culture) and If Books Could Kill. Both are co-hosted by Michael Hobbes who was on YWA before leaving for these two projects.
9580,"I'm also very fond of Hell or High Rollers. Maybe not if you're a hardcore fan who insists on following the rules exactly, but it's a lot of fun."
9581,Yes to Ologies!!
9582,Love Heavyweight.
9583,"I binged-listened to the first season of Dungeons and Daddies. One of my all time favorites! 
...second season ... not as big of a fan."
9584,"Heavyweight is by far the best podcast ever made, and it's not even close imo."
9585,"Dungeons and Daddies if you like improv comedy. I think everyone involved understands that it is to TTRPG what flavor is to La Croix. Not to decry the podcast but people going into expecting an actual play or tightly crafted narrative won't get what they're looking for.

I also don't think any podcast list noting MAG is complete without at least an honorable mention to Archive 81. Season 1 and 2 were enjoyable, if rough at times. Season 3+Left of the Dial are peak podcast serials."
9586,No sleep til hippo
9587,J-Town!
9588,I've been binge listening the early episodes ever since someone recommended the Rube Waddell episode
9589,"This has the same effect as Behind the Bastards for me. Good podcast and like their dissection but I can't deal with the headspace and despair I can get from some of the episodes. Unrelated to that headspace, but this was the first place I heard about Floyd Collins and had trouble sleeping for a while after."
9590,Popobawa!
9591,"The Past Times is great too, and never as sad as some of the stories from The Dollop! [This is a saved comment](https://reddit.com/r/TheDollop/comments/hshftd/do_you_ever_have_to_take_breaks_from_the_dollop/fyao4th) I have with some of the best eps"
9592,"Scrolled too long for this. Just the magnitude in which America's (and Australia's) history is sugar coated constantly blows my mind. 

For those not in the know, comedian Dave Anthony tells a story about a historical person or event from American history (and Australian for the live tours) in a relatively serious tone to his friend Gareth Reynolds who's also hearing the story for the first time. The back and forth as the story unfolds is hilarious. And I've learnt so much about history in the process."
9593,"This. A podcast where labradoodle daddy Dave Anthony reads a story from American history to his nemesis, driver and man who killed his father, Gary Reynolds, who has no idea what the story is about"
9594,I was praying to J Town to see this get mentioned.
9595,And I love The Past Times in the same feed
9596,Boy she pops!
9597,The Ronald Reagan two parter with Patton Oswalt is my favorite.  Both hilarious in content and super frustrating that Reagan is held in such high regard to this day.  He was a POS.
9598,"I like The Dollop, but I love its sibling podcast,  The Past Times."
9599,Gary Gary Gary !!!!
9600,Jet pack madness is one of the best podcasts I've ever heard.
9601,Hit em with the puppies
9602,The Rube episode of The Dollop is drive-off-the-road funny
9603,"""All hail the Queen Shit of Liesville!""

It's must listen every Tuesday (and Thursday for Past Times). I've also seen them live twice and they are even better live."
9604,The cereal men episode is pure perfection
9605,So so so many hysterical moments from this podcast that I will not even quote just one. Too many to mention. It is the one podcast that I will put on the new release without fail.
9606,"Honestly, The Past Times is fantastic, also! Hearing about what was news-worthy throughout the last 200 years is fascinating and hilarious."
9607,How is this so far down the list
9608,It's so good! Just did a 7 hour car ride listening to the dollop and it had just in tears laughing. Also very very interesting topics!
9609,We're signing cars
9610,Yes. The best.
9611,This took too long to find. The Dollop is a phenomenal podcast. The combo of historical stories that don't get taught and reactionary comedy is wonderful. The chemistry between Dave and Gareth is truly amazing. Side note: this podcast will make you want to flip a table regularly.
9612,I was looking for this one! The Dollop is great and I recommend it to people whenever I can
9613,I've woken up my wife because I'm shaking the bed laughing silently to myself because of the Dollop. When comedians start riffing it's the funniest shit ever.
9614,I legitimately do not know if it's Gary or Gareth.
9615,Hi Gary
9616,ALL HAIL QUEEN SHIT OF LIESVILLE!
9617,"I usually love these but they kept doing a bunch of live shows that didn't sound as good last year, so I stopped listening. I should give it another chance. The Aaron Burr episodes were my favorite."
9618,They had some magic in those earlier episodes. I find myself shutting off the newer ones after a few minutes.
9619,"Breaking down: Collapse
  
A show about the slow collapse of our world sounds like it'd be depressing but somehow it feels...a bit comforting? It's like two besties chatting about the many insurmountable problems in our world but not in a way that's suffocating, more like let's learn how fucked we all are together"
9620,How do I do a voter fraud and upvote again?
9621,I tried listening to the episode on typhoid Mary. Is it normally that un funny? Good information but by God one of the hosts wouldn't stop interrupting the interesting parts with the most unfunny jokes.
9622,"I discovered The Dollop when the boys were guests on Behind The Bastards for the Kissinger episodes. I am still working through their catalog and loving every minute!!!!
I particularly love it when Gareth plays off Wil Anderson during the Australia live shows. They bring their A-game!"
9623,"If you like comedy and American (and Australian, sometimes British) history, I heartily second this. Be aware the mood of episodes will vacillate between hilarious and depressing/enraging, so if you're in the mood for one and not the other maybe pick and choose the episode. Baseball ones (shoutout to The Rube) are usually funny, as is my personal favorite (#323) the 1902 New York to Paris Car Race. If you get into recent (or slavery era, or Reagan era) politics you're probably gonna get real pissed."
9624,"Dollop is amazing. It has a huge backlog to slog through though. If you're starting out, I'd recommend going back to a few classics. The first ten or so episodes are great, as are:

\- The Rube

\- Ten Cent Beer Night

\- Otto in the Attic

\- The Cereal Men

\- Carry A Nation

\- Brooks Brothers

\- The Hippo Bill

\- Pedestrianism

And so many more. But those are some of my favorites"
9625,"I was dying laughing at the Death of George Washington. I mean absolutely incredible history, the best doctors possibly of all time. Man was tortured to death at the end."
9626,The Willie D was hands down the funniest podcast episode I've ever heard.
9627,"Episode 12, ""The Rube"" is my favorite podcast episode of any podcast.

I've listened to it numerous times."
9628,"I need more podcasts like this and behind the bastards, history with comedy just works so well."
9629,"Holy shit, thank you for this! I hadn't heard of this one, and now I'm laughing my ass off."
9630,"Was looking for this. The Dollop got me into podcasts and is the reason I have a massive crush on Gareth. Shh, don't tell him. Or maybe do."
9631,All hail Queen Shit of Liesville!
9632,Gary - you magnificent bastard!
9633,Came to say this.  Some stories are hit and miss.  When they hit; damn they are amazing.  So much history you just go WTF!
9634,The Willie fucking Dee episode got me hooked !
9635,There more Modern History is great; or where they focus on someone famous and you just have no idea about their real story vs Public persona.
9636,I cant believe i had to scroll this far for this one
9637,Came here to say this 
9638,Is that the tickling podcast?
9639,There are so many great episodes but am I the only one that thinks it has fallen off a bit recently?
9640,Will Anderson is my favorite guest
9641,I've actually seen them live!  Highly recommended
9642,What's it about?
9643,"Still don't understand how Dave can just drop those hard Rs so frequently. I get he's trying to keep things in line with the historical facts but it's always a shock when he quotes heinously racist things.

Edit.
For anyone wondering why I've been down voted so heavily. Dave Anthony, the host of the Dollop, really does quote extremely racist things. He's being historically accurate but do be prepared to hear some extremely vile things said about people of color. I'm being down voted so no one is put off by that fact."
9644,Gary is such a great host!
9645,It's a model based on kindness and soundness.
9646,Was waiting to see this. Only discovered it properly recently after being recommended it for a good while. It's absolutely brilliant. I'm so hooked. I could listen to his voice forever.
9647,Finally. His episode today about his cat dying was so poetic and beautiful I was literally welling up. (Sounds a bit weird but seriously. Go listen.)
9648,We got a tall Enda here lads!
9649,The Moth is fantastic for long runs/bike rides
9650,I can't believe This American Life is this low. I have been listening to Ira Glass for over a decade now. Is it really not that popular?
9651,Both excellent! TAL is the gold standard for podcasts.
9652,Love Ira! Stay with us.
9653,Had to scroll soooo far to find this. Ira Glass basically *invented* podcasting.
9654,"My favorite episode of 'The Moth' I ever heard was a guy talking about being a twelve year old in the early 90s.  ""Me and my white friend went to the music store, and the store security followed *me* around and eventually told me to leave, even though my friend was the one trying to steal tapes.  I thought I might as well actually do something if they're going to accuse me of it, so I went over and bent a life-size cardboard cutout of MC Hammer in half and ran out.  They managed to catch my friend trying to steal something, he broke, and they called his parents, who called *my* parents, and then we were all in the mall security office, where I was was informed that the cutout was worth thirty-eight THOUSAND dollars.  Now, twelve year olds aren't known for their money value skills, but even my dumb ass thought that a $38,000 valuation of a 6ft tall cardboard MC Hammer cutout was highly spurious."""
9655,"The episode about the Peter Pan show that just turns into complete chaos and the cops that set a couch on fire chasing a squirrel sends me ROLLING every time. If I have someone in my car willing to listen to a podcast, that's the episode I pick."
9656,Shit town remains unmentioned
9657,Omg why is TAL so low down? This podcast is amazing.
9658,We actually have a local version of the moth in SLC. The bee. It's live storytelling with a different theme every time
9659,Two of the best in one comment!
9660,"[TAL once did a live stage show Here is the Show.](https://youtu.be/AagGcXs3_IQ) It's on YouTube. I actually don't even consider TAL a podcast because it really predates podcasts. It started in 1995. I don't listen too much anymore because my Saturdays afternoons got to be too busy. I still remember the Real bearded Santa Clause episode as being one of the most interesting, bizarre stories I have ever heard. That had to be 25ish years ago would be my guess?"
9661,"I actually had to stop listening to The Moth. It was so emotionally draining. I found myself crying at so many of those incredible stories. I love stories told by regular people (and some famous, I'm pretty sure Tig Notaro did a really good story about her dad on there), but so many are just heart wrenching."
9662,"I loved this American life when it was fresh, but they recycle way to much content (and rarely even disclose reruns... I think they remix stories into new themes so that the eps are ""technically"" new...)"
9663,I absolutely love this American life but Ira Glass' voice absolutely sounds like nails on a chalkboard to me. He sounds like he has marbles in his mouth.
9664,"These, and Radiolab, are the classics!"
9665,"I listened to The Moth for years, but the stories have just become less interesting to me and they seem obsessed with nearly everyone they showcase having to be a writer and/or from New York."
9666,I really miss the Showtime TAL show.
9667,I recently started listening to it. The problem is the episodes arent all accessible. I think you have to go to their website to find old episodes. Apple only stores the most recent ten episodes
9668,The Moth has so many good stories. Helped me improve my story telling. But its my ex's favorite and makes me think about her so I cant listen anymore
9669,I'd like to add Spooked and Snap Judgement to this list.
9670,Can't believe I had to scroll so far for TAL!
9671,"Yes, both of these should be much higher up!

It's insane how consistently good every episode of TAL is."
9672,[removed]
9673,"I listen to ""The Weekly Planet"" while I'm running and there have been too many times when I've burst out laughing as I've passed someone and had to explain through fits of laughter that it's not them, it's just the thing I'm listening to. 

I also follow James and Mason to other podcasts like ""Do Go On"" and ""Filthy Casuals"" because they are naturally funny no matter where they are."
9674,Such witty guys. *Almost* like having two Australian Lee Macks bounce off each other.
9675,This is one of my two fav podcasts. They're reliably funny and their hearts are in the right place.
9676,I'm doing my part
9677,I love it when James just goes off the rails about random topics. These guys restore my faith in humanity.
9678,ROD KNEE!!!!
9679,I was hoping someone would mention this one. Anyone know any other similarly good ones about the same type of stuff?
9680,Every other podcast is a pig rolling down a hill.
9681,I agree!
9682,I listen to a different Podcast every day. (Same each week as all on a weekly schedule). The weekly planet is the highlight of those. Head and shoulders above the rest.
9683,West World!
9684,"The guys are hilarious but I've just lost all interest in what they talk about (comic book movies, bad franchises, video game movies). I'd love to hear them talk about a more broad variety of movies and TV."
9685,"Hello, in 1242 three Florentine monks developed a new form of basket-weaving"
9686,"It's made for radio, so it has a set time limit and usually Melvyn is really good at making sure the academics don't get too much into the weeds.

One of my perennial favorites."
9687,"Sounds interesting, thank you for recommending it!"
9688,This is gold.
9689,Yes!! I've listened for years and feel like I've gotten a more solid education from it than I did my four-year state university degree.  It's excellent.
9690,The episodes on the gin panic in the UK and the gold rush in California are particularly good.
9691,"He's so cantankerous I had to stop listening. You only know because they gave you their EXPERT KNOWLEDGE in note form, Melvyn! Stop snapping at them!"
9692,Rob Harvilla is a hell of a writer.
9693,When I started that one I thought I would just listen to a handful of episodes on songs that I liked.  I quickly went through every episode and some of my favorites were for songs I hated.
9694,Third Eye Blind episode is hilarious. As is the Oasis one.
9695,He speaks pure prose. And I love the way he starts seemingly so far off topic but slowly circles in without you realising.
9696,"Oh no, don't do this to me. As a 90s teenager this one is going to occupy all my time."
9697,"I gave this a shot last time i saw it in a thread like this. Couldn't recommend it enough,
 I have relistened to the whole thing so many times inbetween show breaks.

I could listen to Rob forever, definitely won't know what to do with myself when the show comes to a conclusion."
9698,"I like to play a game with this podcast. I put an episode on when I get in my car then I see how long I get before Rob gets to the point of the episode.

I call it: How long does it take for Rob to get to the fucking point?

No joke though I love this podcast."
9699,"This one is so much fun. I always learn a lot about 90's culture (I was just a kid then), and I gain appreciation for an artist I may not have given much thought to before"
9700,I think I listened to their episode about All I Want For Christmas. It was dope. I didn't really get into the pod though because I don't really know most of the songs.
9701,The Torn episode is so fucking good.
9702,"Ctrl+F for this, just to make sure it was mentioned.  It's an absolute gem

And it's worth noting how deeply *respectful* he is, no matter the song or genre.  From indie rock to bubblegum pop. 
 He really takes time to tell the story of artists trying to make art, and I am super down for it"
9703,That Tom Petty one warmed me like a heavy blanket
9704,"Such an incredible series. I'm so glad he took it beyond the planned 60 songs. And I'm grateful that it introduced me to Rob, whose writing is fantastic."
9705,"I'm shocked there's not a Nirvana song in the mix, and yet a Hole song.."
9706,"Oh, I *need* to give this one a listen.  Thank you!"
9707,"Rob has yet to come wack on an old school track

Also shout out Bandsplain both rule"
9708,"I liked this podcast but then the episodes started getting longer with more filler. I get that he's a rambler, but it's hard to sift through."
9709,"How much europop does it have? As someone who loves europop, but doesn't know much other 90s music, this sounds potentially interesting."
9710,But do they extensively sample the songs in question?
9711,"Might also like the ongoing history of new music, then."
9712,"For anyone who likes this I suggest they listen to A History of Rock Music in 500 Songs.  The early episodes are a bit rough as the host, Andrew Hickey, gets his bearings but once he hits his stride it's incredible.  The most recent episode is 3 hours and 20 minutes on The Velvet Underground.

The story is weaved together, with threads intertwining, starting all the way back in 1939 or so."
9713,"I'd never heard of this podcast and after seeing it in this thread I checked out a few episodes.  By all accounts this podcast should be right up my alley.  I'm a huge music nerd, especially rock music, who grew up in the 90's.  This should be my new favorite podcast.  But I just can't get past the host.  He talks the way the most pretentious Rolling Stone writers write.  He comes across as being so far up his own ass that you can't tell where he begins or ends.  I do like him better during the segments where he has a guest and they're talking more conversationally, he comes across a lot more genuine and likeable at those times, but when he's doing his solo thing where he's doing the actual story I just hate it.

&#x200B;

Also like bro I respect different opinions and all but I don't care how much you like Kim Deal's singing voice there is no fucking way The Breeders are better than Pixies.  Absolutely mental!"
9714,"For anyone who hasnt listened,

#Start at ""bob's fridge"""
9715,but are you listening HARD enough?
9716,Just don't listen to it while operating machinery.
9717,Great podcast for people who like hosts that speak in riddles and/or rhymes
9718,"Wade's dogs are doing fine, by the way"
9719,Yeah... That's like having 3 buddies in the car with you. Perfect for road trips alone... Just be careful...
9720,distractible ! came looking for this one
9721,"What is it actually about?

>a space to have thoughtful discussions about funny, out there, or otherwise interesting stories from everyday life

Could you please be a little more specific? Cause the official description just sounds like pals bullshitting, but based on the love here it must be more interesting than that sounds"
9722,"Its the dreamed Boner Podcast come to life. I actually listen to it for sleep. I cant listen to music, white noise, etc because it distracts me, but somehow I sleep like a baby when I put on Distractible."
9723,Just make sure you don't listen while you're driving!
9724,The story of Bob's fridge has become the stuff of legend
9725,I'm severely disappointed that I had to scroll this far to find the correct answer
9726,Ok but have you heard of the ship of Theseus?
9727,"Surprisingly good. Have been a fan of Markiplier since he started his youtube career, but when they announced the podcast I didn't think too much about it. But it's SO relatable and genuinely funny. Makes me wish I had friends to talk about every kind of thing like they do."
9728,took me too long to find this comment :(
9729,"GO! My Favorite Sports Team as well. Very interesting, for both those who know nothing about sports and vice versa.

As for Distractible, I'm still waiting for the three peens to address the fact that they're getting older."
9730,Eight inches... AROUUUND!!
9731,When I turned around...
9732,"Don't listen while driving or operating machinery, also did you know Bob has a baby that doesn't sleep?"
9733,Just be carefull driving!
9734,Have you heard about the Ship of Theseus?
9735,"I love Mark but fuck the podcast, and stop throwing it at me every other video."
9736,super well researched and hilarious (even if about shitty stuff)
9737,"Can't believe I had to scroll this far to find a comment that wasn't ""basic comedy podcast"" or NYTs top podcasts of the 2010s."
9738,"I really enjoyed all 3 seasons. Gives new perspective on historical events. 2003 Iraq Invasion, Cuban missile crisis, and the Korean War. 

In season 3 about the Korean War, I didn't even know about the Jeju uprising. 30k+ people were killed by the hands of the US supported South Korean govt."
9739,loved the first 2 seasons but have not been the biggest fan of season 3. ofc its the 1950s  but the stories just seem more anecdotal.
9740,#POPOZAO!!
9741,"Anyone started at the beginning? There's only 130 or so episodes.  

I managed 2 a day, but found myself interjecting conversations in regular life saying ""Yes Points!"" etc, so maybe don't try to do as many as I did "
9742,Honestly the amount of times I've said something from the soundboard out loud without realizing it is pretty embarrassing. It's just gotten to the point where the drops come automatically in my head
9743,Now *this* is interesting
9744,"I'm British and I love this podcast, I don't understand like 90% of their references but the interactions make me laugh out loud sometimes

Helps to have seen Workaholics as well. Too many adverts though I will say. 

You're a disaster my guy."
9745,WATERTRASH
9746,Weeooo. Sometimes I don't need intelligence. I want my braj's to braj out and laugh.
9747,There are so many replies to this comment and none of them describe what it's about
9748,Let's gooooooo
9749,Greatest pod of all time. The podcast every male friend group thinks they could make while they're sitting around stoned. But it's the workaholics guys so it actually works for them
9750,Yes points!
9751,I'm your friiiiiend
9752,WHO CARES?
9753,okaaay let's go
9754,**I'm livin' in a nightmare**
9755,I love their content
9756,[deleted]
9757,Very underrated podcast and I'm not a huge Workaholics fan. They're fucking hilarious.
9758,Your boobs are huge
9759,WPAP!
9760,AlLegEdLy!!!
9761,Satan??
9762,I'm gonna cum!
9763,The rippin and the tearin
9764,Naked grandma
9765,YES POINTS
9766,You guys want some cookies?
9767,"Yes, points!"
9768,*WHO CARES*
9769,"I am constantly saying ""that's life"" in the same accent. I have no idea what it's even from, but it's so perfect."
9770,SHUT UP BITCH!
9771,One of my favorites for sure. The dynamic between these four friends works so well. I'm a huge fan of Workaholics so naturally I'm going to like their comedic style but it's even better than I expected.
9772,NAKED GRANDMA!
9773,AHHH amazing!! Didn't know this existed. Love these guys.
9774,"Anyone looking to get into it, I would recommend starting with the episode 53. It's the guys recapping their trip to the Ozarks."
9775, Diarrhea 
9776,Give him his flowers!
9777,"I hate workaholics, but that's a great podcast."
9778,"I did listen a while, but too many ads"
9779,"May Flaggy Flag wave eternal

I think that us Tim's all miss HI, regardless of divisions between us. I miss plane crash corner :("
9780,Wait...the old episodes on NPR with Click and Clack??
9781,"I used to listen each week while my dad took me to Saturday soccer practice. Before you could download the episodes, he used to tape them while he was at work so we could listen together. He always said it was so I wouldn't be helpless if my car ever broke down, but I'm more grateful for the special time we spent together."
9782,One of the best radio programs ever! You don't even have to know a thing about cars to enjoy it!
9783,"Adding to NPR, this American life, serial (although that's really old) wait wait don't tell me, fresh air, 1A, planet money, and tiny desk"
9784,One day I will edit an hour long montage of Click and Clack just laughing. It was always my favorite part of any show because it was so genuine.
9785,Is it me or did they take off the majority of the podcasts on Spotify and only do like five releases at a time?
9786,This brings back memories of being a kid driving around early on the weekend with my dad. I had no clue what they were talking about but I just loved to listen to them talk.
9787,"If you are into Aviation, Opposing Bases is like Car Talk for pilots.  Two air traffic controllers who are hilarious with the same giggling and jokes through the whole show."
9788,I am a white lady who knows fuck all about cars. This show is amazing.
9789,I *love* car talk!!
9790,"Fun fact is that their esteemed producer, Dougie ""Bongo Boy"" Berman, also created Wait Wait Don't Tell Me."
9791,On this note the curmudgeon show with Jason Cammisa an Derek Tam Hyphen Scott is my favorite automotive podcast.
9792,Bob Ducca's lists are the funniest long running bit.
9793,Brendan Small playing 3 characters at once is the type of chaos that makes this show for me.
9794,Love me so Hot Saucerman
9795,Just wanted to share one of my favorite [clips](https://youtu.be/L8MBUZjJX7Y) from CBB.
9796,Shout out to Lily Sullivan
9797,You gotta laugh!
9798,"Its a Monster Fuck, they love to Fuck and Suck.... So aggressive but one of my absolute favorites!

9799,Harris' Phone Corner (RIP)
9800,Happy belated wet day!
9801,Hot tub foot?
9802,"Comedy Bang Bang has a lot of bad jokes, but the jokes are so incredibly rapid fire that if you can hang on you'll find yourself richly rewarded."
9803,hey nong man
9804,I found my people. This is... rather good
9805,"Holy shit thank you for sharing that clip. My neighbors are probably wondering why someone is guffawing at 2am, though."
9806,Comedy Bang Bang is trippy. Almost complete anarchy. I love it.
9807,"Love bang bang, Threedom might be even better"
9808,Heynong Man!
9809,Scrolled way too far far for this!
9810,"I love CBB but I hadn't heard that clip, jesus thank you so much, i'm laughing like an idiot at 1:12 am"
9811,My people!
9812,How was it THIS FAR DOWN?? It is like one of the OG podcasts lol
9813,"Threedom with Scott Aukerman, Lauren Lapkus and Paul F Tompkins has a load of improv games too, worth a listen"
9814,"Along with their spinoff series Comedy Bang Bang Presents, where the best characters get their own one off podcast, or even series. My favorites being ""Who Me?"" With Bobby Moynahan as Batman, ""Hey Randy!"" With Tim Baltz as Randy Snutz, and ""Bonanas for Bonanza"" with Andy Daly and Matt Gourley parodying being fans of the 50s/60s western TV series Bonanza. Think ""How Did this Get Made?"" (Another top 10 podcast with Jason Manzoukas, Paul Scheer, and June Diane-Raphel) but entirely Bonanza based."
9815,"Tis humanity's podcast, my dear boy!"
9816,There are so many comedians that absolutely kill on that podcast.
9817,I scrolled too far to see this. Hot Saucerman is on Mount Podmore!
9818,Happy Belated Wet Day!
9819,comedy bang bang and threedom are the only pods that truly matter
9820,A sort of spin-off of CBB is Bananas for Bonanza.  It checks all my boxes and it's brilliant IMO.
9821,I've permanently added Wet Day to my family's calendar.
9822,The Ghost of Richard Harrow and Bobby Moynihan's Fourvel character are top tier episodes
9823,You'll like This is Important. Great stupid comedy podcast.
9824,"That and Hollywood Handbook. Just two sweet, intelligent boys hanging with a lot of improv or comedy people."
9825,Still drying off after a big Wet Day!
9826,"Also Threedom, like it even better"
9827,i tried listening to this and never found it funny after listening to like a year of it. 
9828,The following...
9829,"Most Multiple Personalitys (Ep 387) with John Gemberling is where everyone should start imo.

Don't bother with Deathray (1 - 160). Sorry, old fans, just not as funny."
9830,Oh man I can't believe I forgot about this one!
9831,Someone tried to get me to listen to this maybe 8 years ago as my introduction to podcasts. Just couldn't get it
9832,This podcast used to have me in stitches though it's gone downhill. They used to have a lot of celebrities on the show which was fun. Still I liked CBB even when I had low patience for podcasts.
9833,"I love improv and the guests, but i loathe Scott Auckerman. He's known for constantly interrupting guests."
9834,The episode where Rob talks about almost fighting a guy in the In-N-Out drive thru was both hilarious and super insightful. Really get to see them through a different lens.
9835,Cut that cut that cut that
9836,The John Wayne surfer bit is one of the funniest jokes from a podcast ever
9837,The episode where Charlie and Glen pretend to have a conversation between Murdoch and Mickey Mouse is one of the funniest things I have ever heard.
9838,"Really looking forward to it coming back once they finish the new season of IASIP. I love that it's not strictly a rewatch podcast. I'm enjoying a few rewatch podcasts (Office Ladies is fantastic, Fake Doctors, Real Friends is pretty good), but only like 75% of the Always Sunny podcasts are based on episodes of the show and sometimes they barely touch on the actual episode."
9839,I love it when the guys talk about their other projects and the rest pretend like they've never heard of it.
9840,"Maybe its because I have donkey brains, but this is the only podcast I've ever liked"
9841,Crazy how often Steven Spielberg stops by
9842,Creep
9843,"Seeing it live next week, babyyyy"
9844,Is that the first/only 'tv series recap by the actors themselves' podcast to start while the series itself is still running?
9845,Those 3 guys can really podcast well. I'm hooked
9846,"I'm coming in hot today, guys."
9847,"I was blown away when I heard Lin-Manuel Miranda's actual voice on the Nightman Commeth episode. When Charlie mentioned they'd be having Lin-Manuel Miranda on the show, I assumed he would be the same style guest as Steven Spielberg."
9848,This podcast is as good as busting a nut!
9849,Mister Quest
9850,It's a bunch of detritus
9851,"Recently it is becoming just the guys chatting about their day then reading several sponsored ads throughout the video. Maybe 20% if not less, are of them actually talking about the episodes."
9852,Coming in hot
9853,It's too bad they haven't uploaded a new ep since Feb :/
9854,"I love Sunny, but surprisingly I did not like the podcast. It kinda felt like a whole bunch of nothing. There were a couple of good bits here and there but it really made the guys look like they had no idea what they were doing (just my opinion)."
9855,"I don't watch IASIP, why would that podcast be worth listening to?"
9856,I would like to say this is a terrible podcast. In that it is awful to listen to anymore. It is however the best video podcast. It is a must watch because of all the clips they insert.
9857,When does it start back up baby needs his fix
9858,"The airport ""out of milk"" story cracks me up"
9859,"The episode when they all get drunk made me realize that Rob and I are the exact same when we're drinking. After every shot, about 5 minutes later you hear Rob, ""You know what we should do? Take another shot."" Lmao! Plus you gotta love watching Charlie strum his guitar and do his thing."
9860,"""This Paranormal Life"" is a great comedy podcast as well, it's two guys who ""investigate"" paranormal things and determine if they're real or not, but it's really just well done and clever, their back and forth and editing is amazing."
9861,Damn I forgot about this one. Thanks!
9862,"Why is this so low. Unbelievable. Best pod out there and I've tried a lot.

Solviet."
9863,Basically the only non-drag queen podcast I listen to. I'm a patron and got to choose a topic and it was surreal when they finally made it!
9864,Sad I had to scroll this far to find this! Currently on my second listen through all of them (now that they've gone weekly instead of twice weekly)
9865,"This is the only mention of DTFH on this list!! It's so, so good and to hear the original interviews from Midnight Gospel is so cool. Hare Krishna!"
9866,Really hoping DTFH would have more upvotes. Probably not the best for mass appeal though...
9867,Love jason mantzoukas. Also the reindeer games episode is hilarious and i love the live mindblowing they had at the santa claus revelation because i was having it with them too
9868,I love the podcast but hate how many bad movies I've watched because of it.
9869,GEOOOOSTOOIOORM
9870,"Anyone think that as they've become more famous, the more obscure their films have become?"
9871,What's up jerks!
9872,This is a party more than a podcast. And I mean that in the best way.
9873,It is the only podcast that I love the live audience episodes more than studio. The audience energy just makes it so much better.
9874,I love the episode about *Voyage of the Rock Aliens*.
9875,Is this a Jacob's Ladder scenario??
9876,Laugh out loud funny
9877,Geyooooooby
9878,Took too long to see this.  Especially their live episodes.  S tier podcasting.
9879,Loved listening to 'The Number 23' episode. Without even watching the film I love knowing how hilariously bad this film is without having to watch it
9880,This show makes long drives go so much faster. Incredible.
9881,"We Hate Movies is better.

Edit: I'm getting down voted to hell but Paul Scheer is the most unfunny dude to ever make it in entertainment. 

Mantzoukas is hilarious, though."
9882,it use to be great.
9883,Best podcast ever. Wouldn't change a thing. 3 out of 5 stars.
9884,Cult! Cult! Cult! Cult!
9885,Hail Lucifina!
9886,"Just posted this as well, wasn't expecting another comment mentioning him even though I'm pretty sure I discovered him through Reddit"
9887,"FUCK YOU, FUCK YOUR FAMILY!"
9888,Had to scroll a little longer than expected to find the meatsacks.
9889,Hail Nimrod!
9890,His rendition of Ed kemper is the best. MOTHER!!!!
9891,My podcast queue is like 90% Dan Cummins.  Which is not a bad thing at all.
9892,"Don't forget the hot, hard father-daddies."
9893,"That's what I'm looking for. Hail Nimrod, fellow meatsack."
9894,Scrolled way too far for this one. Hog folk v. Dog folk!
9895,I scrolled way to far to see this. What is big deal?? Hail Nimrod!!
9896,"Happy to see Timesuck listed here. I'm going to drop Scared to Death, also by Dan."
9897,Hail luciphina!
9898,"Dang, I knew I'd find timesuck but didn't think I'd have to scroll down this far. We gotta pump timesucker numbers waaay up lol"
9899,"I like Timesuck. It's not bad. Dan can be a little too much for me sometimes, but overall it's really enjoyable.

If you like Timesuck, I can't reccomend Last Podcast on the Left Enough. In my opinion it's the best Podcast ever, and has similar topics. 

This Paranormal Life is also fantastic if you like comedy podcasts, although it's admittedly much different than Timesuck."

9905,Hail nimrod! #1 podcast for me. This podcast got me through the darkest time of my life. Keep on suckin you beautiful bastard
9906,"I've found my people! Hail Nimrod, and praise be to Bojangles!"
9907,Mmm peanut-butt butter!
9908,"Came here to say this, glad someone has already given you an award but it needs like 30 more to get every meatsacks attention"
9909,"Yes. 3 out of 5 stars, wouldn't change a thing. 

I do miss Is We Dumb though."
9910,I'm more of a *Scared to Death* fan (listening to the new episode as I write this)
9911,I was surprised I had to scroll so far to find this! Recently found him (like 2 months ago) and I'm hooked. My favorite podcast
9912,Bump
9913,YEA THE YARD IVE LOOKED FOR SONLONG
9914,RIP Breslin 
9915,"Thank you for mentioning the yard, I can finally rest easy. Such a silly podcast with goofy guys and their tomfooleristic natures."
9916,ALRIGHTMAN
9917,"One of my favorites lately is a true crime comedy podcast called Lil Stinkers. I'm not really into true crime stuff, and the comedic aspect of the show is perfect for someone like me."
9918,"You might like this sounds serious, its a parody of true crime"
9919,Have you tried Small Town Murder? James and Jimmy are hilarious!
9920,Ever listened to All Fantasy Everything? It's the only comedy podcast I've tried and I wonder how it stacks up against other popular ones
9921,Fork em devils 
9922,Glad to see this. Highlight of my week. I can't share this show with ANYONE because it is completely unintelligible if you don't start from the beginning.
9923,Guess we are comment leavers now. With that being said. EAT THE PENCIL!
9924,"Agreed, just funny dudes talking laughing and messing with each other."
9925,Deep lore about nothing
9926,"So glad someone commented this!!! 100% my favourite podcast. Along with ANMA. They compliment each other perfectly, are a great length, and always leave me in a better mood."
9927,"""this sucks"""
9928,"This podcast is the weekly update of a group of friends who find interesting and innovative ways to go about their lives, mess with one another, and introduce self imposed challenges frequently to their own detriment. 

This is a serial podcast... but not serial as in a ""follow the narrative"" podcast. It's serial in that they will discuss cereal and if you don't listen to the previous week you won't understand why it is absurd and clutch your stomach levels of funny that one person ate cold oatmeal and the rest ate lucky charms. (Not a real example)


On the off chance someone bothers to read this far down, or is doing a search for things like funny, entertaining, easy to listen to, friendly, driving podcast, or laugh out loud. This podcast is one of the highlights of my week. Despite being only about 1hr long, this podcast gives me hours of additionally wild conversations with the friends and family I share the topics of that weeks episode with. You'll find yourself having opinions on things you never considered having an opinion about, such as ""is the best food improved by adding air"", ""what separates a condiment from a sauce"", ""Can sunglasses make the bathroom more fun"", and ""what is the best animal-movie genre animal?""

A cereal comedy podcast focused on the gamification of the ordinarily mundane parts of life."
9929,Was hoping someone would mention this one. This and Face Jam. Best RT Podcasts
9930,Oh shit. I have just become a comment leaver.
9931,"I went scrolling for another podcast, but was pleasantly surprised to find this"
9932,Took too long to find this comment
9933,"To plug some other RT pods I love:

- Ship Hits the Fan: all about shipwrecks in history
- 30 Morbid Minutes: macabre topics/historical tales
- Cult Podcast: comedians talk about cults. I listened to this originally and when they joined The Roost I started listening to RT's other podcasts. It fuckin rules - go check it out, but remember don't drink the Kool-Aid!"
9934,Eat the pencil Andrew.
9935,That's what I call my abusive ex-husband! 
9936,HAAIII GAY!
9937,Can't stand their bad takes anymore personally and how weirdly racist their fans are
9938,"Surf's up my guy, 100%"
9939,You can't say Hey Riddle Riddle without mentioning Hello from the Magic Tavern
9940,"RToM has one of the greatest [starts](https://youtu.be/ZVcTKb_3PW4) to a campaign I've ever heard.

Also.. DING DONG GOES THE BELL AND THEY'LL HEAR IT DOWN IN HELL"
9941,"I'm glad HRR is so popular, love that shit"
9942,BABY BABY BABY.. CRAB RANGOONE!!
9943,The Sweater ep is my favorite
9944,"I'm not a weekly listener because I feel like I'm at my limit of weekly audio content consumable at the moment, but Hey Riddle Riddle is so great. I binge episodes every once in a while because I find their sense of humor and chaos really enjoyable. It's also just a fun idea for a podcast!"
9945,"Love me some Hey Riddle Riddle, named my cats Riddie and Puzzie"
9946,"Rude Tales is so good. 

""I'm Thicc as hell and livin' twice as well"" was my friend's response to ""how are you?"" For months after that episode."
9947,Oh These Those Stars of Space is great if you like rude tales and star trek.
9948,"As someone who actually likes riddles, I can't stand HRR. The improv bits are annoying and not funny. I like when they riff on the shitty nonsense puzzles that are impossible to solve, The Book, etc. I just wish the podcast was all talking about the riddles and no improv, because I like the hosts but it's just not my kind of humour"
9949,"If you like hearing about middle aged men's bowel movements and children's sick, it's the one for you!"
9950,"The 'Witch Doctor' bit will go down as one of the funniest podcast moments I've ever seen, genuinely has me bellyache laughing every time I listen to it without fail. Lewis's classic deadpan delivery is just perfect for the bit."
9951,"I listen to every episode when it comes out. Always entertaining.

The back catalogue is also killer. Usually you can also find some of their older YogPod podcasts in the catalogue, since (for most sources) they just changed the YogPod branding to Triforce. Some of those early episodes are fucking *gold.*

> ""Some guy drew a picture of me talking into a toaster."" ""That is exactly what you sound like.""

> ""I am Dave *exclamationmark* Yognaught and I have the balls!""

> ""Name a colour that doesn't exist."" ""Borange."" (No hesitation)

> ""Your grandad was a bee? *Your grandad was a BEE? What the FUCK?*"""
9952,"Can't believed how far I scrolled before I seen someone mention this, for anyone interested it's mostly about gaming/geeky stuff mixed with comedy stories from the three hosts life's

Ps. I have a tiny penis

Edit: Thanks for the gold"
9953,So you have a tiny penis and or gapping vagina?
9954,Smartless is my current favorite!
9955,I can't believe this is so far down the list. The David Spade and Ricky Gervais episodes of Smartless had me rolling
9956,I enjoy smartless but sometimes the constant interrupting a guest so the hosts can make fun of each other get too much for me
9957,George Clooney's retelling of the cat prank he pulled on his roommate is never not funny. Also the conan obrien + stephen colbert skiing story 
9958,">Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend

Agree with Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend"
9959,Smart less is a great listen.
9960,"As much as I like the smartless host as actors, I think they leave a lot to be desired as interviewers. 
Hardly any questions and constant over talking one another. 
Plus, I can do without the constant suckoff fest provided for every guest. 
We know you love them and every single guest is your favorite."
9961,These and fly on the wall
9962,Smartless is my fav.  Had to scroll too far to find it.
9963,Scrolled way too far for Smartless! Those 3 guys are really good together and have excellent guests!
9964,Smartless is the BEST.
9965,I love Smartless. I also listen to WTF with Marc Maron. He has a ton of great guests.
9966,"Hoped this'd be here. I discovered them recently and they're now my favorite commuting buddies as I work through the back catalogue. Particularly enjoy the more historical stuff. They have this almost MST3K-esque vibe to them I really enjoy (Marcus being the Joel/Mike host character, Ben being the Tom Servo, and Henry being the Crow... naturally.)"
9967,Ergit perznin
9968,Alcatraz means pelican
9969,Wanna buy horse pics of Henry Cavill??
9970,Agrarian?
9971,The episodes about the secret Dulce alien base is seriously the funniest shit I've ever heard.
9972,DON'T MIND THE RED EYES

9982,Megustalations
9983,But why true crime now?
9984,"Had to scroll until I found love for the boys! Hail yourselves, everyone!"
9985,I'm getting interbulated by the LPOTL slander I'm seeing around here.
9986,"Yesss. I really don't like most topical podcasts that are hosted by comedians (I start to get super annoyed by the constant interruptions, with the over-insertion of bits I usually don't find that funny and dudes loudly talking over each other mid story), but I make a hard exception for these guys. It's always just pure ridiculousness!"
9987,"It's easily the best researched true crime podcast in the game. I've listened to dozens and none ever get into the level of detail that they do while still telling a compelling story and being funny about it.  

Also, low key the most poignant mental health awareness podcast out there. You just have to read between the jokes for that."
9988," Side Stories makes me laugh, because Ben and Henry are such idiots without Marcus to guide them.

 And I mean that in the kindest way possible."
9989,Hail Satan!
9990,"we have a seven foot inflatable alien in our house named henry, a squishable plague doctor named marcus, and a mini bigfoot we named ben. we like the reverse uno of the names."
9991,"Finally, the cannibalism gets started."
9992,"Mmmm, that opinion is so buttery."
9993,"I have fond memories of driving through DC as I had driven up there to buy some; ahem, grey-market goodies ;), and listening to the LPOTL episodes on Satanism; I was still super new to the show at the time, but I was stopped at a light, listening, in the summer, with my windows down.

Ben, Henry and Marcus all start saying ""Hail Satan"" or something similar repeatedly; and I have mild hearing loss since birth, so I keep my volume pretty loud.

I'll never forget when I looked off to the right and saw a man and a woman staring at me and my car with a complete look of shock and horror - they must've been tourists too cause I mean, it's DC they definitely saw worse before they went home. I mean I still remember walking by some tents and hearing one homeless man threaten to skin another one alive with his syringe if he didn't come over and give him a back rub. A few podcasters hailing Satan ain't nothing lmao.

But yeah absolutely great podcast."
9994,Hail yourself! LPOTL was the first podcast I ever listened to and it's still my favorite.
9995,I was not expecting to laugh so much during the awfulness of the Arthur Shawcross episodes but Ben was killing me on those
9996,I was irrationally excited when I saw their poster on the wall at the beginning of Scream VI.
9997,The animated clip of Minnie and Nanny is my go to when I need cheering up and results in me crying laughing so hard I can't breathe
9998,Who was phone!!!!
9999,My people!!
10000,I love the Side Stories episodes the best honestly
10001,WHO WAS PHONE?
10002,Can't wait for the 40 part episode on the 100 years war
10003,Hail you!
10004,"Never be scared of the short, short man,
He's always kind and he has a plan.

10007,"it's kind of a big dill, but you know what, you're thinking about it -- don't think about it"
10008,Hail Gein!
10009,There's boooones in them thar hills!
10010,"Ben's bit on the priest being stopped going through airport security with his 'exorcism kit' had me crying laughing.

""Sir, this is just vodka and dildos"". 

Man, when they're good they're untouchable."
10011,"A lot of people kept recommending this, but I couldn't even make it through half of one episode because one of the hosts was so insufferable and annoying. Completely killed it for me"
10012,"**I AM USIDORE!!** Wizard of the 12th Realm of Ephysiyies, Master of Light and Shadow, Manipulator of Magical Delights, **Devourerer of Chaos!** Champion of the Great Halls of Terr'akkas! The elves know me as Fi'ang Yalok, the dwarves know me as Zoenen Hoogstandjes! And I am known in the Northeast as Gaismunenas Meistar!
And believe me friend, when I say that there are other secret names you do not know yet!"
10013,"I haven't listened to this, but I'm assuming it's done by the same guys who do Hey Riddle Riddle (which is also great) because it gets mentioned a lot"
10014,"I loved it for a while, but started to get really sad that they wouldn't give Arnie a break. Like, it started feeling like the others were just bullying him."
10015,Vote 1 Mayor Banana
10016,I scrolled way too far to find this answer.
10017,"So happy to see it mentioned! It's my favorite podcast, I have been listening consistently for about a year and I am almost current, I dread catching up and having to wait lol."
10018,Chunts' up with that?
10019,Mmmmm chuntttttt pleeeaase!
10020,"I've listened to every episode since day one. I'll sometimes have other podcasts that I like more, but HFTMT is a comfort that I go back to"
10021,It was good before they destroyed the tavern.
10022,"It's also in that great British tradition of being made by a middle-aged bloke in a shed. Part of its charm is how ramshackle the whole thing is, and how likeable David Crowther comes across."
10023,I also enjoy History of the English language podcast.
10024,"You may enjoy ""We have always been idiots"" in which a medievalist and her co-host discuss (mostly European) history in a casual but very well-sourced manner and dispel common beliefs about the middle ages."
10025,
10026,Hamilton Morris always has the most interesting subjects
10027,I feel like you'd like The Blindboy Podcast based on this list
10028,I'm adding Crime In Sports to this.  Same format except the idiots are athletes (and silver haired mentors)
10029,Sad this is so far down....
10030,I pay $10 a month to listen to it early and for all the extra shit...these two have me by the balls every week
10031,"It's also worth mentioning that the production quality is very high which makes it easier to enjoy. There's been a ton of podcasts that I wanted to like, but the audio quality was shit, voices either too bassy and washed out or it sounds like the mic is on the other side of the room."
10032,"FINALLY!!! Took far too long to find someone talking about the amazingness of James and Jimmy.

 If you like Small Town Murder but haven't checked out there other podcast Crime in sports it's actually really good. I don't give  a damn for sports and you don't need to either to enjoy Crime in Sports"
10033,Can't get enough of this podcast
10034,James and Jimmie have ruined most other true crime/comedy podcasts because they've set the bar so high. I tried to listen to MFM because everyone raved about it and it was just awful. Asshole for life over here!
10035,Had to scroll way too far to find it
10036,Shut up and give me murder
10037,Meth Falcon!
10038,"By far and away, my favourite podcast. Every part of it - from resident reviews, local events to the actual murder stuff. Absolute gold"
10039,Double fun if you find an ep of your hometown....
10040,Currently binging their back catalogue since I forgot about them for eons. Really well researched! Surprisingly!
10041,"Was hoping to see this. Love those guys. Also, even if you don't like sports their other podcast is quite entertaining. Some of the shit that goes down is insane"
10042,My girlfriend got me hooked last year. My absolute favorite. Their live shows are amazing.
10043,OMG. Came here to make sure this one was on the list. I love that show.
10044,I started from the very beginning and am now about 10 episodes from catching up to the most current episode. Not sure what I'm going to do when I can't just binge their episodes. Might start Crime in Sports.
10045,I started listening to them during COVID. Learning about the small towns and listening to a true crime story? Yes please!
10046,"Let's go on a trip, Jimmie."
10047,Had to scroll too damn far for this. James and Jimmie deserve all the success in the world
10048,One of my absolute favorites!
10049,YAYYYY
10050,"This is my absolute favorite podcast! I've been listening for almost 4 years now and have started all over again. Looking forward to their latest project, ""Your Stupid Opinion""!"
10051,"You, sir, may fuck off!"
10052,Love that they started the Express - it's almost perfect timing for my trip to/from work if I put it at 1.25x speed. They play off of each other beautifully.
10053,Check out Last Podcast on the Left if you enjoy STM. It's absolutely hilarious and one of the most well researched podcasts I've ever heard.
10054,"I will say I recently tried to get a friend into them on a car ride and I found there was SOOO much side talk. Like I get going off on a tangent for a joke etc, but it took like 25 minutes of podcast to even get through the real estate report (which I do enjoy) but then immediately back off topic with a callback joke (from that episode, and it was a mid joke at best)

Idk, maybe I just picked a bad episode but I definitely needed more shut up and give me murder"
10055,"I agree. Anyone here that hasn't gone to any of their live shows, make sure you attend at least one. They're just as hilarious and you get to see pictures of everything, which makes it even *more* hilarious, because they play off the audience reactions to them very well."
10056,"If you can see them live, do it."
10057,"Oh my god, I just started listening about 10 days ago, and am about 1/3 the way through their catalog. I fucking LOVE them! I walk to work, and pour candles for a living, so im listening to podcasts about 10 hours a day. These dudes have well researched, hilariously told stories of murder and mayhem. My new favorite !!"
10058,Yes! I love these guys so much. I can be have a shit day and they never fail to make me laugh. The subject matter can be grim but I wouldn't want to experience true crime in any other format
10059,Don't forget the 6-part series on Jonestown called 'Promised Land'! Incredible deep dive into Jim Jones from his youth to his death.
10060,The Louis CK president ones are fantastic.  The Nixon dream story legitimately had me in tears laughing.
10061,Most people can't handle the cast
10062,These normies are not ready for the dawgz
10063,SODTAOE
10064,I've almost cried laughing to this too many times. I like it a lot bc I feel like they are really genuine and honest with eachother and the viewers.
10065,Just found it. I fucking love this shit
10066,"Some would say, the only real podcast out there.

*wicky wild wild*"
10067,THEY GOT GUYS
10068,DAWG
10069,Its the only real podcast left. Sodtaoe
10070,How good is our god?
10071,Why did I have to look past 200 horrendous recommendations to find this and upvote
10072,"It's hilarious looking at old posts on Reddit when the whole snl thing happened. People were freaking out.

The cast is a treasure. Matt is just a fuckin G."
10073,SODTAOE!
10074,Great pod
10075,"Where my dogs at?

&#x200B;

Also, Kill Tony and Are you Garbage"
10076,Took way too long to find this. Should be top comment. How good are our gods?  Fucking Redditors
10077,Our God is a good god.
10078,"Ctrl f > Matt.

at lightspeed, the DAWGS"
10079,"I'm a recent convert and have been going through the Old Testament. Truly an all knowing, all seeing Pod."
10080,It's the only comedy podcast other than Stoner Dadz that I can tolerate and is actually funny.
10081,MSSP is hilarious but sometimes they talk about history and I want to fucking blow my brains out because they BEGIN their 30 minute discussion by being completely wrong and then just lean into it lol.
10082,Q+
10083,"Strict Scrutiny is fantastic along with other crooked media shows like Pod Save America.  ""She spoke not eloquently but clearly...""  chills"
10084,"If you like Strict Scrutiny, you should also check out Five-Four. For an idea about their vibe, their tagline is ""a podcast about why the supreme court sucks"" and in their merch store you can get a mug that reads ""Antonin Scalia is dead since 2016."""
10085,"Seconded, two other good legal podcasts are 5-4 and ALAB."
10086,Great podcast! I especially love their relentless mockery of Sam Alito.
10087,Strict scrutiny is fantastic. Pod save America is great too.
10088,"For legal analysis on current cases, I love Cafe Insider and Stay Tuned with Preet."
10089,This sounds great.  We need to be talking more about the Supreme Court right now.
10090,"It's less nuanced than Strict Scrutiny but still great: What Roman Mars Can Learn About Con Law, formerly What Trump Can Teach Us About Con Law. Roman Mars of 99% Invisible fame is joined by a constitutional law professor to look at modern constitutional issues through a historical lens."
10091,Do you listen to 5-4 as well? I'm a huge fan
10092,5-4 has much better politics. All the Crooked Media stuff leans into neoliberalism pretty hard.
10093,"No thank you, I've had enough /r/WhitePeopleTwitter to last a lifetime."
10094,Thanks for this!
10095,Sisters in Law podcast is also great
10096,My favorite podcast and one of the first I discovered when podcasting was so new they were hard to find. This is far too low on the list.
10097,I have been listening to that podcast for over 15 years.
10098,Came here for this
10099,This podcast is better than a meatball.
10100,One of the OG podcasts. Can't believe it's still around.
10101,Skeptics Guide always goes directly to the top of my podcast queue.
10102,"Also for sciency stuff, Ologies!"
10103,"And if you like that, try *Talk Nerdy*. SGU panelist Cara Santa Maria's weekly interviews with scientists reviewing their books and research is an excellent deeper dive into the thoughts and personalities of the authors."
10104,"Love that show.

The three Novella brothers also do an occasional podcast called *Alpha Quadrant 6* that reviews science fiction movies and TV."
10105,"*Great* podcast!  In a world where most journalists have no idea how to read or interpret a study, having the SGU break it down for me (and teaching me how to break it down myself) has saved my sanity!"
10106,"My favourite!

Steven Novella is my spirit animal. I totally relate to him, when someone makes a shortcut statement that is generally well understood by most, but he'd still go ""actually..."" and be super precise, just to be sure. My husband is not amused when I do that ;)"
10107,Are the hosts Bob/Steven Novella? I actually have an audiobook I haven't listened to yet by the same name
10108,"I don't know, I like science but find that show to be a bit insufferable.

I like the Nature podcast for a science news source. Common Descent is really fun one on a more specific topic."
10109,Not to be confused with Citation Needed.
10110,With Nima Shirazi and Adam Johnson
10111,Love this podcast. Media criticism at its finest
10112,I don't think I've recommended any other podcast anywhere near as often as I've recommended Citations Needed.
10113,Based
10114,There are too many podcasts with similar or exactly the same name. You'll have to be more specific.
10115,The one where they read wikipedia pages?
10116,"Agreed, though I do find I'm vibing a bit less with it now that both Jad and Robert are done hosting."
10117,"I think I unsubscribed years ago. I think after Jad and Robert left/retired. For a while it was great, then one of the episodes was something I'm an expert in, and I found lots of problems. They took a very narrow view of the scientific literature and did not consider the majority opinion, instead taking a minority opinion and treating it as uncontested truth. I lost a lot of respect from that moment."
10118,Oldie but goodie. It's the production quality for me...very immersive
10119,Used to be good. The podcast's trajectory since the departure of jad and Robert c has been lackluster.
10120,I liked it until they started getting too....idk...extrapolationary? Like some bacteria farts and all of a sudden they need to turn it into some message about consciousness transversing the infinite expanses of the cosmos.
10121, *was
10122,"Old Radiolab was excellent. Modern Radiolab is 90% reruns, 5% recycled content, and maybe 5% new."
10123,Radiolab used to be great but something went very wrong when Robert Krulwich retired and they basically stopped talking about science.
10124,I tended to listen to. Radiolab while driving or doing something else with background noise and their ridiculous over the top editing of sound effects and interjections just started frustrating me.
10125,Sucks since Jad left
10126,"Ugghhh, I hate the sound design in radiolab, with the constant cutting and jumping around.  Interesting content, though"
10127,"Maybe it's me, but, I feel like it's changed a lot since Jad Abumrad and Robert Krulwich stopped hosting. I don't want to be mean, but Lulu Miller's contribution seems vapid and frankly, obnoxious. It's like she's playing a character who is absolutely ignorant about and fascinated by everything. Kind of reminds me of Steve from Blue's Clues or similar characters. 

Plus, the content is underwhelming. I feel like they're stretching out what should be a 3-minute long segment into an entire episode. 15 minutes in and it starts to seem almost uncanny. In fact, in a way, it seems like it's become more of a children's show. So at best, I feel like I'm not part of the target audience anymore and at worst, I feel spoken-down to."
10128,"Honestly the backlog is a great intro to podcasting and what it can do: share facts, stories, histories with laypeople and experts with pleasant conversations and atmosphere."
10129,Obligatory can't believe I had to scroll so long to find this. Radiolab is amazing
10130,"Late 00s Radiolab is goated. One of the podcasts (along with Maron, early Rogan, and This American Life) that I actually listened to on an iPod."
10131,"Yes ! Found it

This (and Bob Saget) got me through lockdown"
10132,Love love love Radiolab! Even the new episodes.
10133,"Scrolled for this one, an absolute goldmine of knowledge  and free!"
10134,So informative 10/10 recommendation
10135,I love it because he sounds like if Henry Rollins were a neuroscientist.
10136,Was looking to recommend this together with The Drive by Peter Attia who is very focused on longevity and they have a lot of the same guests.
10137,I second this!! It will change your life
10138,Agree. The video series on YouTube is quite good to follow as well.
10139,"If you're trying to get better physically or mentally, Huberman Lab is a must. It's the only podcast where I take notes."
10140,"This should be one of the top answers. However, I understand why a long format podcast that focuses on wellness and is very dense with information isn't as appealing.

Most of the answers here are popcorn entertainment. You put it on and go about your day. With Huberman, you really have to give it your full attention to digest the information."
10141,You know if andrew lives in or frequents austin? Think i spoke with him once
10142,I have a love hate relationship with this one. Fantastic information. Just absolutely demoralizing at times finding out what I'm doing to myself with some of my bad habits.
10143,He's solid on neuroscience but veers heavily into bro science and extreme confirmation bias seeking tendencies in other areas. Do not recommend any non-neuroscience episode.
10144,"This comment should be in top. 

The best thing about this podcast is he tells actionable steps rather than just vague theory."
10145,9/10 stoner friends recommend
10146,"YES. HUGE crush on Hubes. I love a smart man who teaches me something! 

Lex Fridman used to be good until he started pandering to sex workers and controversial figures."
10147,"God no. Huberman frequently peddles medical/health advice based on individual non-clinical studies. He's constantly getting rocked by MDs/PhDs in their respective fields for this, no one makes medical decisions off a single cell culture/animal model study, you need a meta/review in human.

No doubt really interesting info from a smart guy...but he's clearly run out of things to talk about within his scope and is now creeping into fields with further shakier theories. Personally seen multiple friends subscribe to really intense diets and unnecessary supplement. Fine to listen to if you have a strong science background and can scrutinize his suggested, but the overwhelming majority of people are not; huge disservice to listeners imo"
10148,Spooked! Is also amazing!
10149,"Agreed, 'Cadillac Hotel' made me cry, 'Border Hacker' made me buy the book."
10150,I used to listen to it on NPR when I would deliver food during my collage days. Love that show.
10151,Yes!!! 1000/10
10152,"Lore is great but I have a limit. 
His...speech cadence.


It


Drives me...insane...."
10153,Lore and CoC are the only podcasts my wife and I listen too. Many a long car trip have been spent listening to creepy stories.
10154,Myths and legends is a good one for those that want a lighter version of lore.
10155,"Speaking of podcasts he's produced, Noble Blood with Dana Schwartz is one of my faves."
10156,I'm Aaron Mahnke
10157,You should listen to Bridgewater! Aaron Mahnke is one of the producers. It's a audio drama that I can only describe as the love child of lore and welcome to nightvale.
10158,Don't forget Noble Blood by his company!
10159,Kind of like Mr Ballen?
10160,"His ""13 Days of Halloween"" annual audio dramas have also been fantastic and entertaining."
10161,"Unobscured is amazing, too."
10162,"I have to listen to Lore in sporadic bursts. Like it'll be all I want to listen to for several episodes, then I have to take a break from Aaron. I LOVE the subject matter and it is incredibly researched and told, but his narration can get to you."
10163,This one led me to bridgewater which was fantastic. Misha Collins and Nathan Fillion? Yes please.
10164,"I feel like Lore has been slipping the last few years. Maybe I'm just too used to the podcast, but it doesn't seem to have the same depth or ambiance as in early seasons. Not that it is bad, just not as good. Like the host has used up all the good material he was passionate about and is now having to manufacture episodes out of whatever he can find."
10165,Lord is fantastic
10166,Season 1 and 2 of LORE may have been some of the best podcasts ever.   Season 3 lost me and it became almost unlistenable.
10167,"When I first started listening to this, I was telling a friend how much I enjoyed it. Then she said she couldn't... get over... how... he talks... like this. It was like my brain couldn't unhear that and I got through two more episodes before calling it quits."
10168,Dark History is similar but about 1000x better researched and the host actual has a good voice and speech rhythm
10169,"I used to listen to a similar podcast called 'Unexplained' by Richard McLane Smith (sp?). There was amazing writing and pacing to it, but the last couple of seasons he's resorted to this slow uptalking that I find HEAVILY annoying. His old stuff was solid.

I HATE uptalking and scripted+acted radio back and forths, or eternal rambling without editing."
10170,Is lore similar to Myths and Legends ?
10171,I'M Aaron MAHnke.... and THIS..... Is Lore...
10172,Can't do the Ai generated voice. But the content is super interesting.
10173,I don't even see one of my top fives Worst Idea Ever!
10174,Thanksgiving tradition
10175,"Nothing has better production quality then hard-core history. Dan is consistently top rated for audio quality for a reason, the decade plus of radio experience shows. The analysis is more in depth then hardcore history but the audio quality is unmatched"
10176,They have a podcast too?
10177,The best podcast tbh
10178,Such a good one!
10179,The constant is my jam. One of only two podcasts that I contribute to their patreon.
10180,"My favorite physics podcast is Physics Frontiers
  
They're not pop-sci, but they take a topic (Loop quantum gravity, multiversality, retrocausality) and discuss several  research papers and talk about why it works or why it's a house of cards
  
It used to be a professor and a Mardi Gras sculptor who self-taught physics . .but the sculptor randomly died last year, so Jim gets random folks to discuss their work
  
They only have like 7 patreon donors, and it's literally the most scientific podcast I've ever found. I don't think there's another podcast where the hosts actually read papers from a journal instead of university PR or a pop-sci book.
  
If you want real modern physics from physicists, there's no better podcast than Physics Frontiers. TP is okay, but I can't shake the feeling that it's just a slick undergrad's YouTube outline instead of something challenging and compelling.
  
QuantaMag is pretty good, but they're only like 12-minute abstracts. But their long form writing is pretty great."
10181,"Highly recommend The Constant. One of my favorite podcasts.

I like the common descent as well, although it can be a *touch* dry. But if you like paleontology, it's super good."
10182,"Finally, someone else who loves The Common Descent! This podcast is so good, not only for its scientific content, but also because the hosts have a mission to educate. And no ads!"
10183,I like the idea of Ologies more than the podcast itself. I appreciate her enthusiasm and curiosity and there's legit some good information. But she tries so hard to be cutesy.
10184,"Oiii, I'm fram bostone"
10185,"I always notice, and love, when his guests' jokes fall flat or miss, or their contributions are something entirely obvious... he'll just kinda be like 'yeah', and then get back on topic and move on, he always sounds a little dismayed but undeterred and professional."
10186,...but you know what won't slaughter thousands of children?
10187,Brought to you by Raytheon! For all your knife missile needs.
10188,I heard the guy who narrates it is a bear of a man
10189,"Listen the the one about chiropractors, it's funny and interesting.  I actually learned a lot about homeopathic medicine from this one as well."
10190,It's a true crimes against humanity comedy podcast
10191,"Make sure you stock up on some throwing bagels.

I got into it because someone linked to the episodes about 8chan and QAnon, and I've been hooked since."
10192,"I love the Stalin episode.

Apparently he loved pranks, and especially loved it when his assistant would replace one of his comrade's guns in its holster with a pickle, kills me every time I think about it."
10193,I still hold the opinion that Robert Evans is the most interesting person alive. He's got such an insanely vast array of crazy stories and talents.
10194,First episode I listened to was the one about Reinhard Heydrich. It was so interesting and hilarious.
10195,"> Behind The Bastards 

i just gave it a try. smarmy and woke. like npr without the charm. ok, this illuminati episode is ok."
10196,I love Lateral. I'm a big trivia fan and Lateral gets me thinking/using that trivia in unique ways. Plus Tom is a gem.
10197,"I love Mr Ballen but for some reason in the podcast format of his show, he does this weird thing where he explains the most simple, well-known thing as if the audience has no idea what anything is. 

Two examples i can think of when he mentioned marijuana he said ""they were smoking marijuana--marijuana is a plant that has psychoactive effects and can cause intoxication"" or ""they went to McDonalds--a fast food restaurant that sells cheap, ready to order food""."
10198,I like it but it has too much ads.
10199,"This needs to be way higher, byyyyyeeeeeeeeeeeeeetheway!"
10200,"The guests aren't all great, but the banter is usually top notch.

I could re-listen to the Stephen Colbert episode every day."
10201,The episode with George Clooney had me rolling. The cat box story he told was classic.
10202,Sinisterhood is great!
10203,"Heavens gate was amazing to listen to, also extremely insightful towards cults and such"
10204,Wind of Change is so good!
10205,"Yes, finally! Sinisterhood!"
10206,"Came here to recommend this one. Without spoilers it's about a guy who was cast in Band of Brothers on HBO and then got a call from his agent saying he needed to get back to set quickly because Tom Hanks is thinking about recasting him because he has ""Dead Eyes"". He ends up losing the part and the whole podcast is him trying to understand why. The best part is he doesn't do it in an angry or vengeful way. He's genuinely curious and treats it like an investigation. It's only about 30 episodes long and has a very satisfying conclusion. Well worth a listen. It explores Hollywood, acting, rejection, our culture's obsession with celebrities and Tom Hanks from a very human level. It's also really funny and has some incredible guests along the way."
10207,Shout out to The George Lucas Talk Show
10208,starting an internship there next week; anything I need to know?
10209,">The only podcast I've listened to so far is Welcome to Night Vale. It's a fiction podcast

Have you checked out any others?

If you like that different style, Within the Wires is presented as relaxation tapes with secret messages/communications that do the story telling and world building. Kind of... Maybe?... Similar but still really different to how Nightvale tells the story through a radio program. Except it's both more direct and indirect. More because it's spoken to you. Less, because the story is told between the lines, or, *within the wires* so to speak. 

Each season changes. The second one for example is an art curator creating a show and each episode is their narration about a specific piece in the art show meant for that exhibit.

Also, if you really are sleep deprived, they'll definitely help you fall asleep!"
10210,You might like Old Gods of Appalachia- spooky Appalachia stories set over the past 100+ years. Or Quiet Part Loud spooky mystery story about a disgraced radio talk show host trying to repair his wrongs...still listening to it.
10211,"Been trying to get into this one for ages- I always end up bouncing off after a few hours.  On paper, it's right up my alley.  How long does it take to kind of develop some story arcs or plot lines that aren't just wacky vignettes?"
10212,"Seconded! It certainly isn't for everyone, but if you like mundane horror mixed with great deadpan comedy (not sure if that's the right term) and very wholesome LBGTQ+ representation, WTNV might be for you."
10213,Beef and Dairy Network Podcast is also a win if you're into Night Vale
10214,If you're gay and sleep deprived what's keeping you from listening to more podcasts?
10215,Started listening to them back in 2014. What a great show
10216,You can always try I Only Listen to the Mountain Goats.
10217,"A guy at work was explaining Night Vale to me years ago, he then started to play the episodes for me at lunchtime. It seemed just like a book I had read by David Mitchell, Ghostwritten. Eventually I searched ""Night Vale"" ""Ghostwritten"" and found a review of that book by the creator where he states it is his favourite book!

I'd recommend getting the audiobook and also Cloud Atlas by the same author"
10218,"That was my first podcast. I've been to a few live shows, but I haven't listened in years. It got a little monotonous for me. But it'll always have a special place in my heart."
10219,They have a book too!
10220,"I agree. Hearing real stories from people's lives is great. So many different types of stories, and storytellers, that it doesn't get worn out for me."
10221,You should check out Old Gods of Appalachia! Southern Gothic meets Eldritch Horror.
10222,It's incredible. At first it feels like a case fic anthology but around season 2 it starts tying in the bigger plot and then you realize almost all the stories are connected. I've listened to it about three times now and I still pick up some small detail I missed.
10223,"If you guys like horror podcasts (and Lovecraftian horror in particular) I have to recommend Malevolent. From their website:

Arkham Private Investigator Arthur Lester wakes up with no memory of who he is or what has happened, only a nameless, eerie voice guiding him through the darkness."
10224,"Honestly, it really never met the hype for me. I listened for several blah seasons before growing tired of the  contrived framing device.

I hear it moves towards an actual plot before melting down in its attempt at a conclusion. 

I'm glad I gave up."
10225,"What I like about Glass Cannon is that they take the crunchy rules very seriously. 

It's a different energy to TAZ or Dimension 20 - because if something cool happens in a Glass Cannon episode - it's truly *earned*.

Plus the cast are hilarious & genuinely good friends and that energy is infectious."
10226,Troy Lavallee is the fucking man. Dream level DM. Androids And Aliens is my favourite.
10227,Adventure Zone is great but it's never been anywhere near actual play
10228,Glasscannon for sure!
10229,"Additional ttrpg podcasts:

Dungeons and Daddies

Not Another D&D Podcast

Rude Tales of Magic

Worlds Beyond Number (brand new)"
10230,"I enjoyed The Adventure Zone so much I thought I liked Table Top Podcasts.

Learned quickly I just like the McElroy's"
10231,I had to scroll way to far to find The Adventure Zone. Those boys deserve so much love for how good it is.
10232,D & D Minus
10233,"""Suck on these, dipshits"" and ""Taako's good out here"" are two of the favorite things I've ever heard."
10234,"For those into gameplay podcasts listen to Spoutlore. It's very good and the people in it are so likable and genuine. Plus, a huge backlog so there is tons of content!!!"
10235,"Never get sick of listening to Heather, Nick, and Matt :)"
10236,It's the primer video game podcast!
10237,"Hell yes. Where else would one experience the joys of the Nothing to Report Report, or Dutchwatch.."
10238,"AFE is the best, and only, podcast that has ever existed."
10239,">All Fantasy Everything. Ian Karmel (Late Late Show) David Gborie (voice of Comedy Central) Sean Jordan (comedian) who draft stuff like ""TV dads"" or ""weird flavor combinations"" or ""state capitals"" and its hilarious.

I can't believe that so few people know about AFE. Glad to see at least one person mentioned it.

Words That You Think Make You Sound Smart is an all timer. Sean's Kosh into the wind and Felonious Monk back to back still makes me laugh every time"
10240,Have you ever gotten this?
10241,They do a lottery ball machine and have for years on that pod right? Surely everyone on the show has gotten it by now?
10242,"I love the deprogram, it is an amazing podcast"
10243,"They are also funny and wholesome guys. I started listening for the animal stories, but now I just the hosts."
10244,I was looking for this one. I still don't think Wes has found his degree though...
10245,"I had to scroll way too far for this one! I literally got a patreon account for this podcast, their voices soothe my dog on road trips."
10246,"started listening to these guys on a road trip through yellowstone and down to utah then back to CO. 

super fun to listen to, great stories and info and they are hilarious."
10247,I love this podcast!!  One of my favorites!
10248,Also National Park After Dark for more gorey nature!
10249,I scrolled forever to find this! Love this pod so much.
10250,One of my favs!  *So* happy he's still doing it despite being so famous now.  I've been listening since before Ted Lasso and it's been great seeing his rise!
10251,"As a straight man, I agree. Also, I'm gay."
10252,The Adam Gayland Show is also okay I guess.
10253,Hell yeah dude
10254,*tents fingers* Go on...
10255,I'm sad I had to scroll this far to find what should be the number one answer
10256,"RIP to Ronaldo Fink Mullen, spent his last moments in a laundry basket consumed by beer fire. The only tragedy that keeps me up at night."
10257,It's a dead podcast now...
10258,What's it about?
10259,"So happy you mentioned Conan's podcast. Him, Sona, and Matt always brighten my day."
10260,Conan has always been one of the best hosts/interviewers.  The rest of the crew there make it even better.
10261,COCKAROOOOO
10262,Conan's podcast is a treasure - it is easily one of the most hilarious and consistently entertaining ones out there.
10263,Conan Needs a Friend basically got me through the pandemic when I was teetering on the edge of sanity.
10264,The It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia podcast is awesome. Reminds me of the Conan podcast. Funny people with great chemistry making each other laugh.
10265,The episodes with Tig Notaro made me laugh so hard I cried and had to stop because I couldn't breathe. I'm not exaggerating.
10266,Wow . The two podcasts I listen to on my morning runs.
10267,"Wow this is the third time I've seen BTB in this thread, I had no idea it was that popular."
10268,Harmontown
10269,"Conan is good but I had to start skipping past the chat at the beginning, it was just the same repetitive jokes that got old."
10270,"I love Where Should We Begin?- but I admit sometimes I fell a little uncomfortable when listening because they go into such personal stuff that it feels almost voyeuristic, like I shouldn't be privy to their conversations. 

I like Nicole Byer's guest selection and her interviews/ conversations. But, man, I get annoyed with her sometime, when it seems clear-to-me why someone wouldn't date her.  I don't like the pride she takes in not knowing something and having no interest in looking it up/ learning about it. Turns out this is a pet peeve I didn't know I had until I listened to this podcast."
10271,Man I love where should we begin. Im so glad she gonna put out new episodes this summer. Its been to long since a new one has been out.
10272,"Try ""Something was wrong"" if you like hearing about people talking about their relationships (with psychos). I started with season 14 and was hooked."
10273,MBMBaM is one of the few podcasts that regularly gets me laughing so hard i cannot breathe. I have to be careful about listening to it in public so I don't look completely insane lol
10274,SHRIMP! HEAVEN! NOW!
10275,"Had to scroll so far to find this. The mcelroy's are just genuinely funny in everything they do. Though to be fair, at this point the inside jokes/call backs are so deep that if you jumped in at a current episode you might think it was a fever dream."
10276,The whole McElroy network of podcasts are a good listen.
10277,"I love MBMBAM, but I am soooo tired of Munch Squad. The stuff brought up is so lukewarm anymore, it's essentially just another ad read."
10278,"what's up, you cool baby?"
10279,"Fucking love MBMBAM, just out here surfing the vibe in 20-sun&sea."
10280,I wanna munch!
10281,"Could've been ""my brother, his brother, and their brother"""
10282,"Man, I know Wolf 359 ended a while ago, but I hope it never sinks into obscurity. The writing, acting, and sound design are all stellar... at least two episodes actually started me crying on the subway. It's my #1 recommendation to anyone looking for a fiction podcast."
10283,"I liked Rabbits a lot. Also Old Gods of Appalachia is top tier, especially when it picks up in seasons 2 and 3."
10284,We Are Alive
10285,"It's been a long time since I've listened to Lore. Loved the podcast, but the host called me a sexist piece of shit on Twitter because I said I didn't think Star Wars 8 was very good. It was a somewhat surreal moment for me, and it's all I can think about when I listen to his podcasts now."
10286,"Surprised to see Broken Record this low. I've really enjoyed most of the guests, even when it's someone I know very little about or have little interest in the genre."
10287,"Damn Interesting could be so much bigger.  Their narrators do a good enough job, but they'd benefit from hiring a professional voice actor, imo.

  Plus their output is rather low, given the relatively short episode length (compared to other podcasts with such length between episodes), so I find myself forgetting about them and not checking back for ages.

 Luckily the articles on the website are a bit more frequent and are fantastic."
10288,"If you love Nick and you love video games and/or anime, then you should check out Get Played. Been a fan since day 1 and its my ride or die for podcasts. Nick, Heather, and Matt do a great show and have introduced me to so many peices of media that I may have otherwise not given the time of day."
10289,I scrolled until I saw doughboys. And it's way down here. Which is ok because they know why they are down here. Much love for Wiges and Mitch!
10290,Damn shame this is this far down.
10291,"Do you listen to yks? They got me into doughboys

Yks is funnier tbh but I like both"
10292,Good take. Schlatt is so funny
10293,I'm glad I found this here! Favorite podcast by far. Season 1 is some of my favorite entertainment of all time.
10294,This is by far the best comedy pod shit cracks me up every time
10295,Why is this so far down the list?!
10296,"Warning: The Magnus Archives is so good it literally ruins the rest of the genre, lol. If you listen to all 200 episodes and then go looking for similar recommendations to fill the void, sorry mate, you've got nowhere to go but down, you already finished the best horror audio fiction out there."
10297,this guy podcasts
10298,"You're Dead to Me is awesome.  I think having the comedian there to not only add humor but also serve as a sort of audience stand-in learning about the topic makes it so effective at helping share facts in a way that you actually remember them.  I listen to other history podcasts as well, but You're Dead to Me is the one where I feel like I remember the most about the topic a few months later."
10299,"Oh hey, I just started You're dead to me.  I really like it."
10300,"Also, you may enjoy Cautionary Tales and Science Vs. :)"
10301,I'd add Music: Sodajerker on Songwriting
10302,"I second for You're Dead to Me, Infinite Monkey Cage and Curious Cases.

I'd add The Life Scientific on the Science category."
10303,"Solid on the history and science there, friend!"
10304,Came to find Infinite Monkey Cage
10305,"Art:  Artholes

Comedy: Smartless, Conan Obrian Needs a Friend."
10306,Love cautionary tales
10307,"My wife introduced me to Hidden Brain, it's her favourite podcast. Definitely is a good listen."
10308,Yes to all of these! Excellent
10309,You might also like Choiceology with Katie Milkman
10310,I'M UPSTAIRS!
10311,Theo is one of the most genuine tall tail tellers you will ever hear for sure. His podcast is a look into a soul
10312,PTL
10313,I love Theo but I somehow never even knew he had a podcast thank u so much for commenting this
10314,"Gang gang, bruh!"
10315,Didnt know he had a podcast -- just looked it up and he posted an episode with Stavros Halkias who is a comedian I've been getting super into lately!
10316,KATS was so good when it was just him and Brendan. Was my favorite podcast until Theo left and they changed it to the golden hour or whatever it is now.
10317,"He was on TRIGGERnometry podcast and that was the first I'd heard of him, it was a hilarious episode, I'll have to check his podcast out"
10318,"I can't handle too much Theo though. As absolutely hilarious as he is, it gets to a point where sometimes it's so unrelatable and outlandish and you can never discern what's real or fake, that I lose interest. It reminds of the south Park episode where they make fun of how family guy episodes are made. Manatees just randomly choosing topics and whatnot to make the jokes. Obviously he is a comedy genius, but it can get a little ridiculous."
10319,"That podcast is really well-done. I also enjoy 99% invisible, of course."
10320,"I really like FDRF. My only criticism is that new listeners would have to start from the beginning to get most of the jokes in later episodes.

Not much of a criticism, obviously! I just feel some of the regular jokes would go over the head of new listeners if they didn't go from the start, such as Dr Penis, Donald shouting and then getting babies to latch again, trying to get Joelle a date, Danl and his mukbang stream, etc."
10321,glad you like the show!
10322,"The first few seasons of commentary during peak Covid were fantastic, lots of guests and stories, but I think they've run out of unique things to talk about as they approach the finish line. Still, a really fun listen.

Would always recommend The Always Sunny Podcast in the same vein, it's even more interesting with the main cast also being the writers and producers in the show, and actively working on new seasons while rewatching old content."
10323,"Hell yeah, love Trash Taste, such a fun listen"
10324,I had to scroll so much to find this lmao
10325,"I tried to get into this as a weeb but I had to tap out a couple dozen episodes in. I loved that they didn't focus on anime and would just shoot the shit with each other, but after a certain point they just relate every single topic back to being a youtuber. Those boys can be super funny when they're not circle jerking about ""content creation"", but that ends up being the subject of like two thirds of each episode after a certain point."
10326,"Only podcast I've ever actually listened to, and I believe I've heard most of their episodes. The crazy thing is I don't really enjoy their individual YouTube/Twitch content at all, but for whatever reason when you get them all in a room to just shoot the shit it's great. Here lately they haven't been as good since nowadays they're mostly agreeing with each other so there's less banter"
10327,"I listen to them but I wouldn't consider them good. I listen to them when I wanna shut my brain off and just listen to 3 goofs talk about anything random, I don't necessarily come out feeling much wiser or knowing something aside from internet celebs at times."
10328,They only talk about what is absolutely crucially important in this world. I need my hot luggage talk.
10329,This is one of my favorite podcasts!
10330,The podcast that got me into podcasts. Specifically the tshirt series.
10331,"This should be higher up.  So much good content.  Currently working my way through the ""Erotic 90s""."
10332,Daddy why u die
10333,I want to be ninja
10334,"> Bad Friends and Conan O'Brien

Taken together, this also sounds like someone completely mangling the title of Conan's podcast lol"

10349,"I am *stunned* that I had to come this far for Casual Criminalist! I'm interested in true crime but I think too many podcasts get caught up in the blood and guts. I'd rather hear about the history, psychology, investigations and trials. I love that Simon is (usually) hearing the story for the first time, and reacts with shock and horror as the story unfolds. And I especially love when the writers get a little too gruesome and he just says ""Nah, I'm not reading that bit"" and moves on. I even appreciate the tangents; they often provide some levity when it's really needed."
10350,Is it because they are pedophiles?

This being so low down that I had to open more comments to see it is sad to me.

Jason Mantzoukas ALONE is worth listening to that podcast but holy shit paul and june + Jason = The best podcast I've heard in a long time. 

They have great chemistry, and make hilarious observations about these movies. I think Con-Air is probably my favorite episode."

10392,"Such a great show but due to the clips this has become more of a visual show and less of a podcast imo. I still listen to the audio version but get pissed off when I can't see the clip they're sharing. 

Honourable mention for 2 bears 1 cave as well. Bert is a bit much sometimes though, if it's just him and a guess I'll usually skip that episode because he enjoys talking about himself a bit too much."

10397,"Absolutely love CaseFile. 

Every Town is also a good one - a lot of lesser known cases (mostly in the USA) and the episodes are around 20 minutes long, which is great if you like something shorter."

10411,"And by extension, David farriers flightless bird"
10412,"Brilliant podcast, the experts are great, dax and monica's relationship is precisely the conflict and resolution i need to relax a little sometimes. I don't know how else to put it, but like, sometimes i am so so amazed at how poorly the average media relationship models itself. Genuine drama is often a miscommunication and rarely intentional- but they're open about when their feelings are hurt and because they are vulnerable, the other person is able to be vulnerable back. It's shocking how rare it is to see, and yet in my life it is how i  try to be, and i relate hard to dax and monica and kristen. I have been so impressed by guests i completely dismissed and also had my admiration grow when guests i like come on. 

The only guest i have ever heard who gave me serious 'possibly put a disclaimer on this one' was the shame author who was trying to explain how people who get fit should not advertise it. Dax made a great point, how low success rate doesn't mean no success rate, and she sorr of dismissed him by saying that losing weight is harder than beating cocaine addiction? Kinda surprised he stayed civil. 

 Anyways, they're great, i'm hooked, i absolutely adore the whole team and the modelling of *hard work* and *conflict resolution* (as opposed to avoidance."
10413,This is very low on the list..... I thought it was one of the top podcasts out there. Guess I was wrong
10414,"I used to love this podcast but stopped listening when COVID happened - I feel like Dax's strength as a podcaster come through so much better when it's in person. The zoom calls, which of course were necessary at the time, killed it for me. Also the move to Spotify wasn't great as I hate using their app for podcasts. 

Is he back to having guests in the attic?"
10415,"I just watched him (and his co-host, I forget her name) get interviewed on rick glassman's podcast (called take your shoes off) and it made me want to check out armchair expert for sure 


seems like a super cool and humble dude with a lot of knowledge to share"
10416,"The very first episode where he has his wife Kristen Bell on as the guest and she spends the whole episode snarkily demeaning him and his podcast idea is one of the all-time great moments in podcasting.  It should be required listening for anyone planning to get married. It epitomizes how a marriage actually works - that my love for you eternally continues to simmer at a level just slightly above my disgust and embarrassment towards you. 

Although I love the episodes where they have celebrity friends from their social circle on, they actually do a fantastic job with all the psychologists and social scientists they have on too.  It's actually sort of the point of the podcast to discuss Dax's recovery and progress from toxically masculine Neanderthal to grown-up man."
10417,Scrolled way way too far to find this. Such a good podcast. And the spin offs too.
10418,His interview with Dog the Bounty Hunter is the best interview of any human I have ever heard- that shit is real!

10428,FINALLY someone mentions My Favorite Murder. Love those ladies!
10429,"Can't believe I had to scroll so far for WTNV. That podcast is the only one that has almost made me cry in public on multiple occasions. The ""I'm still holding the trophy"" line gets me every time I relisten. The voice acting is phenomenal"
10430,"I remember once coming across a limited series podcast about a lost haunted film and lost haunted media is my jam. I went looking for it again a few years after and cannot find it! I only mention it because I remember it being on the same list as some of these titles. Also, how funny it is for media about lost media being lost!"
10431,I have 3 out of 4 bookmarked.
10432,Why did I have to scroll so far to find the SGU?!
10433,Why did I have to scroll this far down to find this entry? It's only like the most popular podcast ever.
10434,"Ay I see you with The Deprogram. Love my boys JT, Hakim, and Yugopnik. They're quite silly and funny, but also very insightful and articulate when they need to be, and they obviously care deeply about what they talk about."
10435,The only podcast I listen to is Trash Taste. Really a good one.
10436,I love Trash Taste it's so stupid. Some people dislike it because they expected an anime podcast for some reason
10437,"I had to scroll insanely far before someone mentioned Trash Taste, how disappointing that more people don't like it "
10438,Greatest Trek and Greatest Gen are fantastic. I sorely miss Friendly Fire though.
10439,"Love Inside of You. I feel like so many podcast interviewers frequently interrupt their guests, but Rosenbaum is a great interviewer who seems to take a genuine interest in his guest stars. If you haven't heard it, the episode where he and Robert Patrick basically become best friends is a treat."
10440,"Yes, currently binging."
10441,"I kind of fell off after the first campaign, but I still go back regularly for the Dungeon Court episodes"
10442,We are the youth of a nation
10443,Currently relistening and on Mage Madness and Ren is just such an incredible NPC
10444,I definitely wouldn't recommend Smartless for comedy fans it's more like late night style Celebrity interviews. The only laughs come from Will Arnett laughing at himself. I quite enjoy it depending on the guest but I wouldn't call it a comedy podcast.
10445,Jake if you read this send me a shirt plz
10446,Hello fellow discos
10447,"Disgraceland is a fantastic podcast. The episodes aren't overly long and Jake is such a good writer that they feel more like a well produced audio book. I just learned about the show two months ago and I've binged almost all of them.

A side effect of the show I've had has caused me to go start listening to bands I may not have paid much attention to before. I've also started going deeper than just the radio hits after realizing the influence and impact the different artists have had."
10448,"Had to scroll way, way too far to find this.

10463,I just want to understand Uncle Bob's job.
10464,Funniest podcast out there. Although it's much better to watch on YT than to listen to.
10465,"This is what got me into podcast to begin. I ended up burning through all their eps super quick once I started. 

Now I have a ritual of only listening on my 25 min dive to work. Always makes going much better especially when I have to finish listening at a particularly tense moment in the story."
10466,It's like he was made in a lab
10467,Found it a couple weeks ago. Listening to the early ones working myself up to the most recent episodes. It is so funny. I enjoy the impromptu sketches.
10468,I adore WWDTM. Wholesome(ish) AF and a good Sunday morning or road trip must include it.
10469,They add levity to some really dark shit. I honestly think they are at their best when they go over historical events or high strangeness topics. They really do in-depth research and also correct themselves when they get a fact wrong.

10472,"The Deadly Analysis Podcast was good for horror movies.

10488,So good
10489,"Ive been loving the villain was right. My favourite part is always the end when they talk about their own heros and villains. Especially when Rebecca usually shows chaotic she is and how she finds the comedy, even when she makes herself the villain."
10490,"Finally, someone mentions ""We're Alive."" That podcast came out in what, 2009? The voice acting can be a little outdated at times but for the most part, it absolutely holds up and is one of, if not the best fiction podcasts I've ever listened to. I still re-listen to it about once a year."
10491,"Definitely, one of my favorites. Have re-listened it."
10492,"And Stephen is such a kind host that he was at first a bit reluctant to even do a proper merch and sub promotion to keep the channel going, his ""click the amazon link"" back in the day was a constant amusement. Love that guy. Still part of my morning bike/ routine, just repeating old episodes when awaiting for new ones."
10493,"At least I was able to find a single Chilluminati reference in this thread. Great podcast with excellent banter among its three hosts. Each of them has a unique style when they run an episode, I love the variety."

10499,So happy to see CMBC on a list here!
10500,"I listened to Astonishing Legends pretty heavily a few years ago. They really jumped the shark when Scott started making things up (see: bold faced lying) about a house they stayed the night in. 

Then they posted a video on Youtube that showed a ball seemingly rolling on it's own. You can clearly see a woman moving her foot like she's pressing something with her toes and then the ball moves. 

The podcast has turned into ""The scientific method is wrong because it requires evidence that we can't possibly produce, so clearly *science* is wrong, not us."""
10501,"I think it's crazy that it's not mentioned more. It's literally the only podcast I listen to and I'm absolute die hard fan.

10506,You listen to all of these?! Wow! That's impressive.
10507,I can't believe youve hit this many and dont have hardcore history/common sense on here. Carlin is one of the goats. Highly recommend based on your list but do yourself a favor and keep the speed closer to 1. Its dense af but soo worth it once you catch his rhythm
10508,Jesus Christ that's too many lol
10509,"This is an amazing list but I can't believe Bone Valley isn't on here. It's hands down the best true crime podcast I've ever heard. 

I also have ADHD and listen to podcasts while doing everything also sleeping."
10510,Fucking saving this comment. Glad to see TPWKY in there!
10511,"Holy Hyperfixation Batman!

This is a good list.  I second a lot of these and found a lot of new ones too.  Thanks!

Also hi fellow ADHDer."
10512,"Given your love of podcasts and experience listening to different shows, could I ask that you take a listen to my show 'History Happened Everywhere'? It's a light entertainment show where each episode takes a random time, place and topic as the basis for finding interesting and unexpected stories from history. I'd love any feedback you feel like sharing."
10513,"> The Trojan House Affair

Is that were all those British guys targeted foreign residential construction workers? I'm just kidding you, that's quite a list."
10514,"You'd love ""In the Red Clay""."
10515,"I always listen 1.5-1.7x speed too, as 1x sounds way too slow.  Awesome list BTW, definitely going to save this for later.

Not sure if you're looking to add to your already extensive list, but if you like fraud/con/scandals, I'd recommend Swindled.  Non-irritating voice, and well told stories of corporate corruption"

10520,I scrolled way too far looking to see if anyone mentioned it. If anyone else bothers with reading the comments: it's one hour of an anonymous person who called in to talk about whatever they want (and it's good).
10521,Shame its not the spookiest time of the year-
10522,Hard agree!
10523,You should check out LeVar Burton Reads. LeVar reads speculative fiction short stories and it's spectacular.

10553,"Listened to the books, then got hooked on the podcast. Almost always great; always good."
10554,I listened to them for a long time and I hard disagree. A lot of their theories are bunk and Stephen Dubner's horrible softball interviews of some of corporate America's worst leaders have ruined it.

But he takes calls from strangers who can talk about whatever they want, sometimes it's anecdotal, sometimes they're having a problem that they need someone to bounce ideas off of.

Lyle just happens to be really good at asking questions and letting callers use their own logic to work through their conundrums without imposing his own morals/values/politics upon them.  But sometimes it's just a matter of square cut vs round cut pizza."

10582,"Can't believe I had to scroll this far to see Pivot and Prof G. 

I wasn't into podcasts at all and a friend turned me onto Pivot. Now I'm hooked. 

I agree a little with the other commenter about Kara, at least at first. When I first starting listening to Pivot it was ""Scott-free August"" and got tired of Kara's constant name dropping. But once Scott came back, I found him to balance her out, and now I don't mind her; I think they play off each other well."

10600,Love his podcast but what annoys the shit out of me is him hardcore simping for Elon Musk.
10601,This probably my favourite podcast. Lex seems like such a well natured human. He has some very varied guests to. He is intensely smart too.
10602,"As a result of his recent interview with Lex, Professor David Kipping is about to start up his own new podcast.  And yes, this is the ""CoolWorlds"" guy !"
10603,This should be higher! Few podcasts have such a range of guests and deep dive up to 5 hours long
10604,"I've only ever seen clips on youtube, but is there actually any substance there? Every single one he seems uninterested in the guest, and usually with very little knowledge about the topics being discussed - am I missing something? I was speaking to a few people recently and they all said they had the same feeling, so I don't understand how he's seen as being particularly reputable.

Edit: it's crazy that this comment went from +8 to -4 in a couple of hours, for asking a question. Thanks to those who actually answered, I'll give him another try."

I really don't get why people liked it so much. 

The plot was bad. The pacing was terrible. The dialogie was awful. The jokes were painful. The voice acting was amateurish, and the characters were largely two dimensional."

They were amazing! Did you move over to ""This is Not a Show""? Tom and Keith are still killing it.

They have also gotten so many things wrong, and refuse to ever correct themselves. They were great in the beginning, but they have lost the plot."

10630,"Tanis was painfully pointless. 

The writing was terrible. The plot refused to progress and the character(s) never evolved.

The writer's never had a plan. 

Each season brought the audience to a potential point of resolution and just left them on a cliff. 

They then resumed the next season, completely ignoring what they had built up to, only to reset to some point after the potentially illuminating moment in question.

Rinse and repeat.

10646,"Yes! I love this podcast!

For the ones who don't know about it -- it's a weekly podcast about food and the history/science/tech related to it. For example, they have an episode all about cheese: the history behind it, what makes it so interesting, how it helps scientists researching microbes. There's another one about seaweed farming and how it is both economically booming and helping to restore ocean habitats. More recent episodes from the last couple years include one about food in sci fi and fantasy books and shows/movies, and a short series on edibles. I always learn something new!"

10651,"Kinda surprised I had to scroll this far for that one. I'm glad I listened to his podcast, but his strength really is in the amazing guests he's able to pull. I find he's not actually a particularly good interviewer. I'm still subscribed, but I'm finding myself listening to his episodes less and less now that I've largely caught up and listened to the guests that I'm interested in.

I think I basically need to take a break for while. Good show, but it can get a little one note."

10656,Likely just not on peoples' minds since it was a one-and-done a couple years ago and not an ongoing thing. Doesn't mean it isn't still fantastic tho

10669,"Also very surprised to not see Tim Ferris listed anywhere. His podcast is quality AND I also don't have time for 3+ hour podcasts. I do love the conversations, but his team could also edit some of them down to less than an hour."

I've also enjoyed ""Risk"", which is live story-telling  that can be hilarious, sad or shocking...some all at once. Not a huge fan of the host, but fast forward takes care of that. 
TED Radio Hour - also has a fabulous variety of topics told by different people. 
The High Gain - fascinating and fun in-depth look at guitars-the history of them, how they sound, the musicians who use them. I always learn and laugh."

10715,It was so much better when Joe didn't think he knew anything about anything except comedy and UFC.
10716,"Damn i was like where is jre, and then i remembered im on reddit and sorted controversial, literally the first comment i saw "
10717,"Sorted by controversial and basically the JRE is every comment. Whether or not you like Rogan, he does have a wide variety of guests and a lot of them are very interesting."
10718,"The downvotes be damned. By no would I listen to every episode, but to write it off entirely is to write off a lot of cultural landmark stuff. Even if you hate Joe, he gets some of the most interesting people in the world on that damn show."
10719,"> The Joe Rogan Experience is a great podcast to listen to!

Just goes to show you how much of an echo chamber reddit is.  The thread is literally ""what's a podcast worth listening to?"", JRE is the top most listened to podcast in the country, and Reddit is trying like hell to downvote it.

&nbsp;

This is one of those moments its important to remind poeple: Reddit is not and never has be representative of the real population.  It is a highly self selected subsection and its demographics are very VERY young.  Average Age of Reddit is teenage.  You'll see alot of studies say that its young 20s...but read carefully and you'll see that those studies only include 18+ participants.  Once you add the teenage dataset in it pulls the number back down.

&nbsp;

And the irony is that regardless of your political beliefs, JRE prolly has a good number of guests you'd honestly enjoy listening to.  It's why the podcast is so good, he has his own beliefs and biases as well all do but he grabs a wide range of people from different beliefs and fields and experiences.  Most of them apolitical.  Some political, and ofc a slight bias towards his political beliefs."
10720,"Agreed, always a fun listen. Reddit hates him cuz of covid tho"
10721,Nice to see Rogan get a little appreciation on Reddit. It's so rare.
10722,"I agree, it's one of the best podcasts. Joe Rogan however is the worst part about his own precast. But like I said, it's still great."
10723,"Idk, nowadays i only listen to the mma episodes."
10724,"Because when you get tired of taking unscientific ""medical"" advice from a Reality TV Star in the White House, there's nothing better than unscientific ""medical"" advice from a Realty TV Star with a podcast!"
10725,"He was better before he started believing his own hype.

Or when he decided he'd only meaningfully push back against one side of the political spectrum, while giving the other basically a free platform, regardless of how fringe their views."
10726,"I can't support that weirdo. The Comedy Mothership? The comedy club ""without cancel culture""? Give me a fuckin' break."
10727,"100%, Only boosted fascists will disagree"
10728,"Check out Levar Burton Reads, it's great!"
10729,He stopped getting guests like Dr Rhonda Patrick on for obvious reasons and most of his guests are pretty meh now I find. Occasionally he'll get an interesting scientist on but there's a lot of dudebros talking about shit they have *no* idea about :/
10730,"His pre pandemic stuff, with the right guests, are worth listening to.  Especially the episodes where the guests did most of the talking."
10731,People on reddit hate him and they dont know why other than the fact that some liberal agencies told them to hate him.
10732,bold of you to recommend the most popular podcast out there. i'm sure they are unaware of this indie gem
10733,"Ya, which is what makes his show such a shame sometimes. There was some quality content before he started sliding further and further down the political scale and before you know it, he's complaining about ""woke"" this and that which began opening the door to even more fringe guests. His takes on MMA and boxing are still spot on though. Absolutely his wheelhouse."
10734,"Joe Rogan has honestly had some of the greatest minds on his podcast, it just sucks he is a.. well, you can fill it in."
10735,"I can't stand the MMA episodes, but all of the other ones are a must listen"
10736,"I thought this was really good, too"
10737,"I just recently finished it too and really enjoyed listening to it, I loved how they approached it and had voices from all sides. What I especially liked was the historical information on the subject of each episode like the growing popularity of Harry Potter, the growth of the internet, women's rights, trans information, information on witch trials. I enjoyed it immensely and would totally check out anything else that team produced."
10738,"Yes it was really fair and balanced, I enjoyed the 3-4 episodes I listened too, but politics makes me mad so I had to stop. Well done though."
10739,"The world is pretty scary for me and my trans partner right now. Just as it is for women. Why should I give someone who argues against trans rights the time of day? I wouldn't do it for someone who was arguing against women's rights.

Edit: I didn't get an answer so I went looking for a review:
[in case anyone else wanted some more details](https://www.vulture.com/article/witch-trials-jk-rowling-podcast-essay-review.html)."
10740,actually the great thing about that is I don't have to waste hours of my life to figure out the obvious truth that she's a disfudting fuckimg pig!
10741,Tim heideckers 12 hour parody of JRE is so dead-on absolutely hilarious.
10742,"Train all day, Joe Rogan podcast all night, all day!!"
10743,But what if he doesn't use his massive platform to spread the thing I believe in?
10744,JRE's great. Voters can fuck off.
10745,[deleted]
10746,"The voters can go fuck themselves, keep on keepin on"
10747,"This is a joke, right? I have to assume yes."
10748,I listened to that one and it was a great episode. I think a lot of people fail to account for the sheer diversity of guests Joe has on the show. It's not some right-winged circle jerk. He actually likes to gain some perspectives from all sorts of folks
10749,Any episode with Duncan Trussell. He has the personality of a golden retriever and the voice of a raspy lesbian.
10750,"Got the victomhood of JRE listeners haha ""Reddit dOeSnt LiKE HiM"""
10751,"JRE is often a top 5-10 podcast in the world. It might be #1-3. It's wild it's buried down here. 

You don't have to like Joe or listen to all of his podcasts but half the ones listed here are only around because of him and he has good guests on."
10752,Sort by controversial and it's the top 10 or so responses. Clearly a lot of people like it and lots really dislike it.
10753,"I don't know why that's so weird. There are a hundred great podcasts that are so much more concise and funny/educational. They actually tell stories or have a plot and aren't just 2 dude smoking weed, joking around. 

He had a huuuge backlash last year and lost a lot of (probably casual) listeners, along with some long-time fans. Once they unsubscribed, his material stopped popping up for them and they moved on. There were so many people who said they only listened to a few random episodes here and there (when he had a guest they liked). 

It makes total sense..."
10754,"On Reddit it's not cool to like some things that Joe Rogan does, didn't you know?"
10755,Just sort by controversial you'll only see posts about it
10756,Thought the same thing
10757,Because Rogan is a big dumb ape-man who used to have interesting guests on his pod. Now he only has right-wing lunatics that deny climate change and perpetuate anti-vax lunacy. There's a million better podcasts out there.
10758,Sort by controversial
10759,"Yeah, I love(d) that podcast.  I'm not signing up for Spotify."
10760,Joe Rogan's is so big I presume it's just assumed that everyone already knows about it
10761,Kinda funny how [this comment is right above yours](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/12j384c/whats_a_podcast_actually_worth_listening_to/jfx1ir5/)
10762,His three hour long episodes get pretty boring sometimes

This is called ""pre triggered"".


Its so pathetic."
10766,"Lmao Joe Rogan is tied with Conan in this thread for most mentions,  yet EVERY person that suggests Rogan adds the little ""durrr get ready for the downvotes"" tag at the end.  

You're all exactly the same.  Most popular podcast out there yet all the fans have this weird persecution fetish."

10784,Smartless is great
10785,"smartless is good BUT the thing that they do post episode where they essentially suck off the guest to death with these over the top praises, like they're your best friend, is so contrived. 

you can have a guest without proclaiming they're the best, sweetest, nicest guest they EVER had, ever, in every episode. it almost seems like a running joke to hear how the guest is the greatest person ever after an episode"
10786,"You're talking SHIT, KARL"
10787,Crazy you get down voted for sharing something that you feel improved your life.
10788,The Sam Altman episode with Lex Fridman was great!
10789,"It's a deeply unpopular opinion to have. 

I was on a long road trip and ran out of my normal listening options, figured I could give him a hate listen one time. But i also wanted it to be something I knew about a bit. 

So I scrolled, and scrolled and scrolled (Holy shit does he ever do a lot of shows!) And found one with somebody I wanted to hear more from. 

I enjoyed it, he is an excellent interviewer. So I went for another.

The next one put me off. It was some snake oil salesmen and although JR wasn't immediately swept up in the magical bullshit, he also didn't tell the guy he was full of shit either, and that's my problem with the guy.  He platforms dirtbags, and I don't respect that. 

But what do I do in response? I don't listen to those episodes. I wait for someone or something I'm interested in and then give it a shot. 

There are too many people that are black and white in this world. 

Do I like JR? No, but I watch fear factor and MMA and a few episodes of his podcast. 

I don't like broccoli also, but I don't actively avoid it in every meal"
10790,"Should be listened to reverse chronological order, Joe really did a fantastic job with the first 1000 episodes, after that it slowly got more and more ""normified"" where guests would treat it like going on Charlie Rose or Late Night instead of what JRE was at an earlier point in it's life. After Covid started it became the Covid and Texas show, and now it's starting to return to form as Joe opens the Comedy Mothership in Austin."
10791,"Hey Reddit what's a cool movie I've never heard of?
  
 ""Ghostbusters""
  
""Back to the future ""

Yeah, the host is kind of full of himself. I disagreed with the attempted cancelation on him, I dont see anything wrong with ""shooting one's shot"" as long as one is willing to accept ""No."" as an answer. Every time the phone messages start playing, I'd be willing to bet $5 he's jerking it in the background.  But, however much we might speculate, the man does tell a good story in an amazing and compassionate fashion. He's like that really cool friend who is kind of an ass - maybe he rubs you the wrong way a little, but he's not overtly a ""bad guy"" and you get so much out of the interaction that it's worth overlooking his (potentially entirely confabulated) flaws."

10888,"You know, Huberman Lab has some great topics and guest, but I got some beef with Huberman. Full disclosure, I have only listened to a few episodes, but they seemed to go like this.   


Huberman:  Today I have a great guest here to talk about X topic, welcome guest!   


Guest: Hi, here is my topic introduction, and a very important fact I want to share  


Huberman: I already knew that, and here is a long uninteresting antidote about me, and why I know that already.  


Guest: Oh great, well here is another important fact about my topic  


Huberman: also knew that, and here is more about me.   


And that's the podcast. Great topics, but boy, does Huberman already know everything, and need his audience to know that he already knows it. I wish someone would make a program to filter out Huberman and replace it with him saying ""interesting, tell me more"" and I would listen to that!   


I think the frustrating part is, Huberman is obviously a really smart guy, and a super expert himself, I do not want to take that away from him... but if he could just feign ignorance on the topic his guests are discussing I think he could get a much better dialog and provide greater education to his audience.   


Rant over, and I admit, I may be judging his podcast unfairly due to my admittedly small sample size. Maybe some Huberman fans can convince me to give him a deeper dive... but lets be honest, probably not."
10889,Boring as shit
10890,What's he talk about?
10891,"That was a lovely write-up , and I agree with every word.
As an interviewer Gilbert was hilariously loose. If he saw an opening for an off colour joke or a dirty rumour about someone getting under a glass coffee table Gilbert would just go for it, however shocked his  guest would be. The same attitude made him so good on Stern.

Frank was very good at attempting to rein Gilbert in and trying to get the interview back on track but Gilbert was essentially uncontrollable, and armed with his wit, encyclopaedic knowledge and hilarious impressions he was really at his best on the GGACP. RIP but thank god he put hours and hours of this stuff out."
10892,Love that one as a fan of trivia and random stuff. Listen to it while doing housework or going for walks. Always interesting and funny
10893,Funny as hell
10894,I prefer the Funny Brothers tbh

10923,Did you know that there are podcasts for things that *aren't* news?
10924,"I miss The Black Tapes. It was one of the only fiction podcasts I got into, and I'm sad where it ended."
10925,I would listen to Mike Duncan read a grocery bill
10926,He also wrote a book about the Marquis de Lafayette that is phenomenal
10927,"He's a wonderful man too. I did a tour with him. Very down to earth genuine guy. 

The audio versions of his two books are also great"
10928,"As much as I love Roman history, this one is my go to educational recommendation. I honestly think this series is probably the single most informative podcast I've ever listened to, in terms of helping to explain where we are in history today."
10929,"I'm re-listening to The History of Rome now, and it's great picking up more of the details I missed the first time.

And Revolutions is great too. Overall, I think I like it more--feels like he has the kinks more worked out and breaking it into seasons of each revolution feels more digestible and re-listenable."
10930,"I enjoyed revolutions (especially the French one) but some like the Haitian get super hard to follow. I have to keep looking up maps of Haiti to remember where everything is lol and who is white/black/free coloured.

Only beef with mike Duncan is that once you listen to history of rome, where he's written these scripts and planned it so well, it's hard to go back to these shitty podcasts where it's just a group of bros complaining about their trip to the grocery store lol. 

For people that like History of Rome though, I've been listening to **The Dark Ages Podcast** and it's pretty good. A true ""successor"" podcast to the history of rome. I know people (including Mike himself) were promoting The History of Byzantium as a successor podcast, but it's honestly pretty mid, and the guy has crammed it full of ads and his pacing is all wrong."
10931,"To add to these two: Blowback and Hell on Earth are both great history podcasts. As is Fall of Civilizations. These five plus Hardcore History have all been fantastic.

Also forgot to add Age of Napoleon. Big mistake, that one is great. 

Also I am somewhat surprised to not see Chapo anywhere around here."
10932,It should almost be required listening considering the geo-political climate at the moment
10933,"Mexico was fantastic, Russia was a slog I got about 2/3rds of the way through and just couldn't take anymore."
10934,Revolutions is far better.
10935,Whats that one about?
10936,"I've been listening through it (On season 5 now) and I can't recommend it enough. Absolutely stellar work, and has really helped me recontextualize parts of history I only knew of in passing before."
10937,"I was studying abroad in the UK listening to the series in the English civil war and stayed jn London for 5 days and was and got to stop by and visit a bunch of places he mentioned, so I got a guided tour of English historical sites courtesy of Mike Duncan. It was pretty sweet"
10938,"until you get to about halfway through the French Revolution and he spends about 15 minutes each episode shilling his book. It sounds ungrateful and whiny, until you actually realize how much that time adds up. I've spent several hours having to skip through him begging me to buy his book every time I try to listen to the French Revolution section again, because the podcast is genuinely great, but man, you thought 90 seconds of ads was bad. Wait until he spends 15 minutes each episode begging you to buy his book."
10939,Also Throughline. Every episode has my mouth hanging open.
10940,The American Revolution series was my favorite
10941,And his new project which is weird but I'm excited for it
10942,"I listened to that one to study for AP European history a few years ago, ended up getting hooked on the French rev. And listened to most of the other episodes too!!"
10943,"I was going to recommend this and was happy to see him at the top. I started listening to his season on the French Revolution and changed gears to the Russian Revolution. Man 100+ episodes of some great story telling. I restarted back to the beginning to go through the rest of it, but I'm a huge fan of Mike Duncan and will probably do History of Rome next."
10944,"It's pretty clear Mike got some serious media training between the two. It's clearly the same guy, but Revolutions sounds like he's having fun."
10945,"Never understood this one, his voice is so incredibly boring and dull compared to every other podcast, it's like everyone's listening to a different person to me"
10946,I can hear that comment
10947,"Yeah, that qna episode had me dying when he said that at the end, that and the appearance of his wife for her literally only time on the podcast."
10948,It's still pretty incredible given that the first episode came out in 2007. Very few people even knew what a podcast was at that point. Duncan is the Godfather of long form narrative history podcasting. If anyone cares his two books are fantastic and also audio recorded by the man himself.
10949,"An issue is that there just isn't a lot of material about that early period (because of the Celtic sack of Rome in the 3rd century BCE) so he didn't have as much to say about it. But I'd also like to have him discuss that period in more detail, I find it really fascinating."
10950,Is that the jumping IN point? Episode 11 is when it kicks into gear with content and production?
10951,Every history podcasts. Also the it's always sunny podcast because LOL
10952,"Mike Duncan doesn't get his high quality Revolutions microphone until Nero. And he doesn't begin raising his voice and cracking jokes until Valentinian bursts a blood vessel. 

Mike is just not as confident in the first 2/3rds. Its like he is whispering into the microphone."
10953,Really like it aswell. Especially the fact that even when he speculates about something it's atleast within the realm of possibilities unlike some other ancient history shows.
10954,"I noticed Duncan doesn't really do reading of sources and accounts, first or secondhand like Carlin does. Love them both though."
10955,Oooh. I've actually been looking for a continuation. Thanks.
10956,"I've found Byzantine History to be better actually. More detail in the podcast, more reference to specific primary sources, and more critique of the primary sources.

I've also noticed History of Rome reference some urban legends as if they're real history, like Christmas being based off Saturnalia or Arius being assaulted at the Council of Nicea. He also references Edward Gibbon a lot, who I've heard is quite outdated. Still a good podcast overall though."
10957,"That's hilarious, I will give it a listen! He's a fantastic narrator/reader/speaker."
10958,"Once that podcast hits the Gracchi, I basically can't stop listening until the Severan Dynasty collapses.

Not that it's bad during the Third Century Crisis, just the history becomes an absolute mess."
10959,"Echo this.  I can't seem to find it either.

10961,"Mike Duncan doesn't get his Revolutions microphone until Nero and he doesn't shed his insecurities and speak confidently until Valentinian burst a blood vessel.

While Rome was suffering the Crisis of the Third Century, I was suffering from the Crisis of Duncan's Computer Fan."
10962,"Episode 34 - No Greater Friend, No Worse Enemy. The quality gets a lot better from around this point."
10963,"I started with Season 3 of Revolutions (French Revolution) because he had a series on the Haitian Revolution (Season 4) and I knew absolutely dick on it aside from it being a slave revolt.

For the Revolutions podcast, I'd say most seasons you can jump into, although some will be easier to understand with a previous season, like French -> Haiti.

Personally, I went French (3), Haitian (4), American (2), Russian (10), Commune (8), Mexican (9), and now I'm on South America (5). Just look the catalogue up and pick what strikes your fancy.

So, short answer: No, not really. Long answer: No, but stuff from an earlier lecture might help a little."
10964,"What don't you like about it? His mic set-up improves from time to time but I never found the difference to be massive.  It sounded like most other solo talking efforts to me, give or take."
10965,How so?
10966,"Mike Duncan, and he has a website where you can listen to it. But it is also available on Google Podcast and Apple Podcast app, no paywall"

10970,"I love the podcast but feel I need to be able to see the slides to enjoy it properly so don't listen as often as I'd like. I usually listen to podcasts while working, walking, driving etc."
10971,"I also love *Cautionary Tales*.  One guy tells a story about something going wrong, maybe interspersed with another very different story that ends up having the same root cause.  It's not really funny, but the stories are beautifully crafted and very educational."
10972,"It gets tiring as soon as they start going on about capitalism, otherwise it's fun"
10973,"Some of my favorites have been Armored Trains, Gulf State Vanity Projects, Group B, and the Titanic episodes."
10974,"I laughed, but I'm sad at how they slandered my beautiful floaty bois."
10975,The episode with the Meat Deck section had me in stitches
10976,The hindenburg episode was like three hours of the most unhinged madness that group has ever come up with and it was god damn GLORIOUS.

 I'm going to keep giving it a go because like you said, the material is right up my alley, but yeah a pretty bad (utterly non-existent) intro that's pretty alienating to new viewers lol."
11031,"Or if you don't share their political leanings. Reddit is really left, so I'm sure a lot of people do, but if you're not a dirtbag left kind of person, it's fucking grating."
11032,"Yes, that is why I stopped listening to it a while back too. The episodes are like 1-3 hours long, which is great in theory. You think ""Yes, this is going to be super in-depth,"" but once you've listened to a bunch of them you realise that about 70% of a given episode is just random chatting about unrelated nonsense. Roz is great, but the other two completely derail every single episode.

If you want an excellent alternative that sadly doesn't have that many episodes, check out *Great Disasters.* Each episode is about 30-50 minutes, but she crams in three times as much information as a typical episode of *Well There's Your Problem.*"
11033,"Glad it's not just me - bailed in the first 10mins because it was so bad. Shame really because the premise sounds interesting, I just don't care enough about a regional sandwich from the other side of the world to power through the inanity."
11034,"Why do you think it's so highly upvoted on reddit? 

That's how terminal redditors sound, lol"
11035,"You might like the Youtube channel the Podcast got spawned out of: https://youtube.com/@donoteat01

There are long form series on Urbanism and a few one-off Videos on engineering and technology, all started by Justin. That spawned the Podcast down the line and transformed into what you listened to."
11036,"The way you become part of the inside joke is if you watch to the entire catalog in one sitting, clockwork orange style"

11042,"You can absolutely listen to it audio only, and I do often, but the slides add to it with more context, information and (especially recently) humour- the addition of Devon as editor was a great choice."
11043,"The slides do give extra enjoyment, but it works fine without them."
11044,"I think the Military PowerPoints one is the only one that really NEEDS visual aids, but you only need to take a glance every ten minutes or so. Most of the time the slides are just a bonus."
11045,"I've been a Patreon supporter since nearly day one, and I haven't watched a single episode in youtube format, audio only. 

I do have Youtube Vanced on my phone so I can keep in running in the background and if it's an episode where I find I'm really interested in seeing the slides, I just pause it on my podcast app and open it in youtube so I can periodically take my phone out and look at the slides."
11046,The only thing you're missing out on is that the chyrons for news segment are usually pretty hilarious
11047,"There's only a few moments that I think are essential to enjoy with the slides, such as Chapo Trap House of Saud, but they're not common by any means. Otherwise it's entirely optional."
11048,with your ears and your eyes
11049,By not looking at the slides. Theres like 5 slides per episode and you can usually get what they depict from the context of the conversation.
11050,"The slides are on YouTube if you want to see them, but probably 90% of the episodes I've listened to have been while I'm driving and unable to look at any slides, and it is absolutely still enjoyable without the slides."
11051, Hope you started the podcast with a really good one like the Titanic one.
11052,"Celebrate International Friends Day, every day"
11053,Glad to hear it!
11054,Some of the episodes were haunting. Everything about it is just perfect. It's almost like a living entity because the characters are just so real.
11055,"It only gets better when you live near the foothills of Appalachia. When I'd visit my at the time boyfriend, I'd have to wake up around 4 in the morning to go to my job an hour away. I'd take the windy backwoods road and listen. Eyes playing tricks as you listen."
11056,And bigfoot
11057,Get off reddit Andy

11059,"Wow wow wow, there are episodes about moss? I need to check that out then!!!"
11060,"It's absolutely the most chock-full of content per minute podcast there is. And everyone is wholly lovable, including their occasional guests"
11061,"I was about to pass this one by bc I now have 700 more podcast episodes to listen to due to this thread, but you convinced me to add it in!"
11062,It's my go to for dentist visits because usually the fear and stress is preventing me from keeping up with those kind of build ups so I get lost and it's frustrating.
11063,Yeh its amazing how far off topic you can get whilst being entertained the whole way
11064,Award for this comment. I love QI and the way you told me that it was a laugh a minute made me listen to 4 hours of it. Thanks so much!
11065,Don't you mean from start to fish?
11066,"100% agree, one of my favourite podcasts"
11067,It's because they're scripted. Literally all their jokes are written beforehand and you can tell. I like how they pretend that one person is presenting a totally new topic to them but then the others start pulling up their own facts on it obviously prepared beforehand.
11068,It really is a great show live.
11069,"Matt Parker and Steve Mould? Yep, I'm in! Thank you for the recommendation "
11070,Also Underunderstood.  I was listening to that one and the algorithm suggested Fish.  Fish is head and shoulders better but Underunderstood has its moments.  There was a musical episode recently that was quite a good listen.
11071,You're Dead to Me. Chap from Horrible Histories hosts and has a different comedian and historian on each week to go in depth on a history topic.
11072,Given that Qi isn't on TV everywhere I wonder if no such thing has a bigger audience.
11073,The farewell episode for her was wonderful
11074,"No, has Anna left?!"
11075,Just thinking that today while listening!!
11076,"I know! So happy she has a baby, though."
11077,Unfortunately somebody got to the panino shop before me this morning and already bought the one panino they had for sale.
11078,I remember one where they were talking about bull semen and one of the bulls was called Beyonce or something. James kept interrupting to tell listeners 'who were just joining in' later in the fact that Beyonce's semen isn't what it sounded like. I laughed for days but I can't remember the episode number
11079,"I've been a fan since there were only about 3 episodes, and I've never had to relisten to any because they've put one out reliably nearly every week for so long"
11080,"Fish, Box of Oddities, and now The Shallow End are three of my go-tos."
11081,I even logged in so I could upvote
11082,"I don't think I have ever heard a dud. The early live shows are a bit uneven because they get the audiende to give them facts, so it doesn't flow as much and they don't riff on each other as much."
11083,Paging /r/nosuchthingasafish
11084,I love it when someone else is filling in and they try to mispronounce it to match. Best thing about the pandemic winding down is no more undisclosed locations.
11085,"I've never listened to it but they once mentioned me.

I guess I should have a listen."
11086,It's Ash's bathtub telling him it's full.
11087,She had her baby!
11088,I went back to episode 1 again.
11089,"> Well There's Your Problem

Go to youtube and watch QI clips, the guys from the podcast do the research for the show, so it to is full of quite interesting facts."
11090,"You go straight back to episode 1, my friend. I've done this over a dozen times, hoping to remember to remember the facts off by heart. Had helped me with trivia night fairly well."
11091,Dude I've been doing the same thing for years too. It causes some wild dreams which are awesome

11098,I can't stand Sarah Pascoe but I've enjoyed the others
11099,*Freakonomicsssss*
11100,Yes. I laugh so suddenly and loudly while listening to this podcast on walks that my dog turns around and comes back to check on me.
11101,I had a friend who kept referencing that book so I spent the whole episode feeling entirely too self-satisfied.  I've fallen for things too!
11102,I was introduced to that book by somebody trying to recruit me to an mlm.
11103,What's wrong with freakanomics
11104,"I appreciate Michael Hobbes so much for how often he talks about the things he fell for, too. Some things just hit a cultural nerve and most of us bought into them. You're a growing, changing person with a perspective that's expanding. That's something to be proud of."
11105,"""You didn't think we'd give you all the secrets in the first weekend did you??"""
11106,"The Malcolm Gladwell episode made me happy, because I've always thought that guy was a bozo."
11107,"After listening to it, I'm imagining Jason Mantzoukas yelling TAX FRAUD...TAX FRAUD."
11108,I couldn't believe the story of the kids melting down the toothpaste tubes to extract the lead to make coins. Such a great episode.
11109,[deleted]
11110,"It had some good criticisms, but the episode often fell into general statements and unsupported claims.  It was worth the listen, but they're really good at making the book seem bad without much by way of specifics. 

The swimming pool / gun example was good analysis though.   The abortion discussion got messy in their criticism... they kept criticizing the lack of data to support the claims, but also referenced all the academic work levit has done and continues to do on the subject. 

Freakonomics was never intended to be a serious science / economics book... just open the readers mind to explore other possible cause / effect relationships.   It does a very good job at that."
11111,"Freakonomics was one of my favorite podcasts until I heard their episode on the book, and it made me cringe at how much i assumed of the data presented."
11112,"Same, but for me it was Outliers instead of Freakanomics."
11113,"It's so healthy for all of us to be knocked down a peg or two sometimes. I often find myself wanting to go parrot factoids I heard on ""If books could kill"" in the same way everyone did with freakonomics etc but then I remember how silly I felt listening to that episode."
11114,I don't remember rich dad poor dad giving a positive light in MLMs. I guess I will go re-read it
11115,"Peter, one of the 3 hosts, also co-hosts ""5-4, a podcast about how the Supreme Court sucks."" Very well analyzed and also very funny."
11116,"This podcast and specific episode came up on Reddit a while back so I gave it a listen.  I liked the original Freakonomics book ok, but I really like their more recent podcasting and find the quality to be excellent.

I had the opposite experience to you, I only made it halfway through the ""If Books Could Kill"" episode before turning it off.  Those guys are hacks."
11117,Yeah I thought Freakanomics was legit lol. Out of curiosity I listened to one episode of the Freakanomics podcast. Literally talking about nothing.
11118,"I listened to Maintenance Phase and now every Reddit thread on the subject of physical health is excruciating to read.

Edit: Predictably, I've summoned the zealots."
11119,"And before that ""you're wrong about"" which was also very good and still not bad without him"
11120,"The other host is from 5-4, a podcast about why the Supreme Court sucks. Amazing show, all the hosts are hilarious jaded lawyers."
11121,Love maintenance Phase!!
11122,The other is a host of 5-4 and it's also magnificent legal stuff
11123,"One of my great joys in life is when Michael has some thing that's so outlandish that Aubrey just yells ""Damn it, Michael!"""
11124,"He also did ""You're Wrong About,"" another wonderfully researched podcast"
11125,"Don't forget the OG Michael Hobbes pod, You're Wrong About.  He stopped hosting a while ago but the older episodes are worthwhile.

His former co-host continued with the pod, but they had a synergy together that is definitely missing, so I can't recommend it after Hobbes left."
11126,"I love If Books Could Kill, You're Wrong About, and especially 5-4, but I'd be careful with Maintenance Phase.  I'm not saying everything on there is untrue, but the hosts have some definite blind spots and biases around that topic because of their personal experiences.  To some extent it's understandable, but it leads them to say things like that it's impossible for 95% of people to lose weight and keep it off, which simply isn't true.

One of the things that really got me to be skeptical of MP (this line was actually in both the first episode of MP and the obesity episode of YWA) is that Michael cites a statistic that says something along the lines of ""30 percent of overweight/obese people are metabolically healthy and 24% of non-overweight/non-obese people are metabolically unhealthy.""  If he were really trying to present the information honestly, he would use parallel statistics (70% obese unhealthy/24% normal weight unhealthy, or 30%/76% healthy).  I think it's really sneaky to phrase your information that way to make obesity sound healthier than it is."
11127,Michael also used to be on You're Wrong About so check out the earlier episodes if you like his content (though I find his co-host there charming as hell and also love the new episodes)
11128,"I listen to Maintenance Phase and even used to be their Patreon subscriber but they have become pretty garbage lately. Their stances on many things stem from a place where their point on specific topics are ""simple truths"" that cannot be scrutinized but the opposing idea is problematic because it is not highly scrutinized.

They also lost my respect in terms of credibility after airing that dumb episode about calories. Imagine advocating removing calorie content from food products and restaurant because fat people are being bullied for choosing high calorie food (???) Imagine advocating for corporations to gain back control to hide what's in the food we eat because ""society is judgemental"". Absolutely fucking NO. Taking away consumer information to protect hurt feelings is one of the dumbest takes I've ever heard. Another argument they had was that people have different metabolic rates and calories from different food is absorbed in our body differently. Okay? That doesn't negate the accuracy of the label I'm any sense and it helps people choose their food better regardless. 

And then there was this one episode where they ""debunked"" a diet book, except they were really just going on for an hour about how the diet book told you to eat less but actually, the diet book should be advocating for social change about body positivity...?????? It's a fucking diet book! Like the entire episode was nonsense.

It's a shame because they really used to have great episodes and the hosts are really good with their presentation and are hilarious

*edit*

I just want to add that despite my dogpilling, this podcast is still a net positive and fun to listen to because they shine light into things most people don't know about the health industry and our attitudes about fat people. Check them out but always be critical about the information you take. This is for anything you read or listen too. Not just this podcast."
11129,And used to be part of You're Wrong About which also has a ton of super interesting episodes
11130,"And their other sister podcast You're Wrong About, which Mike used to be the co-host of."
11131,"Maintenance phase is unlistenable to me. They'll spend 15 minutes pointing out how a line of reasoning is fallacy, just to turn around and practice the same exact fucking fallacy in their own conclusions. 

It's an infuriating cycle of ""yes! Yes! Yes! Wait ... NO ... STOP ... whyyyyyy?"""
11132,He's also on Your Wrong About which is one of my faves
11133,I've been listening to both of these & loving them
11134,Michael Hobbes was also the co-host of You're wrong about! Genuinely any podcast he is a part of is wonderful.
11135,"Other host (Peter) hosts 5-4 (""five to four"") which is ""a podcast about why the Supreme Court sucks."" I love it, though if you're not the target audience (ie, Lefty lawyer) YMMV."
11136,"\> Maintenance Phase

In the USA in 2022, COVID killed 270,000 people.

In the USA in any given year, Obesity kills 300,000-400,000 people.

If an antivax podcast spouted pseudoscientific nonsense about the coronavirus the way Maintenance Phase spouts cherry-picked disinfo about obesity and spins conspiracy theories about how the entire medical establishment has been captured by ""fat-phobia"", we would (rightly) **howl** for them to be demonetized on every platform.

\> very well researched

And yet somehow the hosts don't believe in the first law of thermodynamics, constantly repeat the debunked claim the 95% of diets fail, cite grifters like Ragen Chastain as a source, and somehow think that Cleopatra, a red-haired Macedonian woman, was black."
11137,Just listening to Maintenance Phase. I'm used to listening to UK accent podcasts. Really having to get used to the vocal fry at the end of sentences in both presenters.
11138,"Glad to see this one close to the top! I love MP, it should be required listening."
11139,Maintenance Phase is a pseudoscience podcast about denying the role of obesity in disease and mortality. It has no interest in being well researched.
11140,"I got 6 minutes in and this is just straight up fat apology. Also mentioned Ragen Chastain, no thanks lol."
11141,Love a podcast that approaches obesity like it's totally fine and not unhealthy /s
11142,"Before that he was in you're wrong about!
It's funny but I heard him on you're wrong about and queued up maintenance phase to listen to behind the bastards, and in one of the episodes, they referred to if books could kill and I had to check it out. Atleast the freakonomics one"
11143,"I love Michael Hobbs (sp?). The first time I heard him on a podcast, I thought he was a cute middle-aged white woman by the sound of his voice. Boy was I surprised when I learned that he was in fact, a cute skinny gay man."
11144,Michael Hobbes is amazing. When he has good chemistry with someone it fucking pops off.
11145,"I've not read it but I've never seen reddit so polar about a book bar the bible. People either swear by rich dad, poor dad, or think it's absolute shit that peddles crappy advice to just sell books and not actually help.

I have no idea which is which but it's mad what strong emotions it drives!"
11146,"Michael Hobbes is brilliant and works with other brilliant people. I still listen to ""You're Wrong About"" even though he's gone because Sarah Marshall is also hilarious & brilliant.

Also he started & is still doing ""Maintenance Phase"" with Aubrey Gordon.

I was excited to see he was staring ""If Books Could Kill"" and for me, it's lived up to the hype.

Non-Michael Hobbes podcast: Behind the Bastards"
11147,"The same Michael Hobbes who was in the ""You're Wrong About"" podcast?"
11148,"My only problem with the rich dad poor dad ep was it was such low hanging fruit. Like all the other eps there is some level on the surface where on first glance it made sense but then after reading or learning more it was bullshit. Rich Dad Poor Dad, as they said from the second sentence was total bullshit lol"
11149,"You're Wrong About (especially Sarah Marshall) thought me so much about empathy. 

The episode about Paula Barbieri's mom was beautiful. Just a person with a shit lot in life, and bad taste in men, doing everything to build stability for her kid."
11150,This book was so condescending and made my blood boil.
11151,"Ditto. While they have a lot of valid criticisms on a lot of trash books, I've found that they end up making a lot of sweeping statements not based on fact, too. 

Especially the Freakonomics episode. It's a bad book full of stupid analysis, but their rebuttal was just a lot of smirky smugness and saying things don't hold up by ""modern statistical methods"". Whatever that means. I'm a statistician, so hearing them speak for 90 minutes as authority figures on statistics with no educational background in it really got my goad."
11152,I really liked Hobbes on Your Wrong About but he really need someone to keep them humble like Sarah Marshal did.  I learned a lot from Your Wrong About but I haven't learned anything from If Books Could Kill: it's a lot of preaching to the choir.
11153,"Kind of like that one about Celebrity Memoirs. Recommended here on reddit but it sounded like the hosts were cherry picking just to be douchebags. I couldn't stand it. 

Those who can't do, criticize?"
11154,I do think in few years you could make similar podcast about the host and his own bs. Every idiot know the secret is bad. That doesn't make the analyses valid by default.
11155,I feel the same about this one so far...rebutting smug books with equal levels of smugness. Doesn't really seem worth it to me.
11156,Clearly you haven't been secreting enough
11157,That's Michael Hobbes for ya. Reddit loves his podcasts apparently but I don't like his smug self righteousness
11158,[deleted]
11159,"Regarding their take on The Coddling of the American Mind, they understand what the book's take is. The problem with the book is that 90% of it is bullshit. I read it and there are so many holes and issues with the arguments of the writers. One of their biggest complaints is that the writers continually leave out relevant data and context so they can misrepresent events and try to continue making their point. And this podcast spends time breaking down many of the examples the book uses and filling in the gaps or adding greater context that the book purposefully leaves out."
11160,"Maybe I am remembering it wrong but I think you're missing the point of their issue.  Yes, they are saying ""I don't know anyone who believes that"" but because the book is basically screaming into the wind not establishing an actual problem and how to deal with it.  The anti college student message has been built on isolated anecdotes at specific institutions pushed by uncritical media making it seem like a serious problem through sheer volume and that's all.  When the authors propose solutions it's for problems that existed for fractions of a second on campuses like Oberlin which lead to anecdotes stretched way beyond a point of rationality."
11161,So there's like 5 oceans right?
11162,"No, you need to tell us right here."
11163,"You missed their point then. The writers of that book are full of shit and cherry pick stats out of context, completely misrepresent the stories they use, and generally take random anecdotes to make their arguments without recognizing all the opposing anecdotes and data going against their arguments."
11164,Yeah I have never laughed harder at a podcast than some of Peter's quips on 5-4.
11165,"That's how I feel about Michael! I've really enjoyed Peter so far, too"
11166,I hate read that book because centrist and conservative friends were talking about it and I wanted to know what it said. This book is so full of shit and writers deliberate lie about each topic they bring up that I'm glad these guys skewered this book. That episode was my gateway into this podcast.
11167,They did a episode on Gladwell's *Outliers*!
11168,"Sometimes true growth is being able to go back to something we once loved and realizing the flaws with it. 

Freakinomics I loved at one point and I cringe at that past memory for instance"
11169,Lol what a hilariously bad take. Bitter at their own life? Lmao.
11170,Or is his name Jackery Cider?
11171,"You learn quite a bit from him and his stories as well. Nothing truly subtle or groundbreaking, though if you pay attention you can come away with a much better understanding of cybersecurity and infosec in general."
11172,I love him. Is his name a play on Reciter? As in reciting a podcast? Or is that his actually name?
11173,"Good to know, always found it entertaining and I'll be honest, never did any fact checking after."
11174,I just squealed in excitement. I love cybersecurity and if this podcast is apparently accurate?
11175,He has had way too many grifters on his show.
11176,Jack An E Snyder
11177,Can't believe I had to get this far in here to find a reference to 99pi!
11178,"I've just got into it about a month ago, there are some dry episodes but there are some humdingers thats for sure. 

The XBOX Underground P1 and P2 are insane."
11179,"The more recent one where dude talks about his entire families life of crime for 2 hours is awesome and crazy, talking about stealing pork chops as a kid. Ive listened to every single episode so far."
11180,"Also every episode has some kind of crazy/amazing story that's very interesting, even if you don't have any job or hobby in the cybersec industry."
11181,He needed it after the episode before the most recent one. That was some dark shit...
11182,The Vendor (both ones) is my favourite
11183,"He comes off as an excited teenager, which actually makes for a fantastically humble way to explain complex topics."
11184,I've learned a lot even just about cyber security and how I as an uneducated normie can be more conscientious about cyber security in my own life
11185,"Yeah, same here."
11186,I knew nothing about pen testing. The Freaky Clown episode sold me on this show. That episode was the podcast equivalent of a book I couldn't put down til I finished it!
11187,Those are my faves. Dude goes to jail just for doing his job.
11188,The Iowa one actually made me angry because the sheriff came back and tried to act like he wasnt the bad guy.
11189,The ones where the guys were hired to test the security on a government building and get arrested was great
11190,"I loveee this podcast and you're so right. That intro slaps! I live for that little riff after ""and this... is Darknet Diaries"" lol gets me so pumped!!"
11191,"I always felt that moody, atmospheric intro was immediately ruined by the upbeat music for the ad that followed."
11192,I Love the dad jokes he adds on the end too!
11193,I think the fact that he doesn't is what makes it so appealing.
11194,Malicious Life tends to go a bit more into the technical stuff
11195,"I would appreciate if Jack talked nerdy to me, but I believe the show wouldn't be as popular if it got that technical."
11196,What's it called?
11197,"Totally. He is a good journalist and interviewer. That makes it a (edit) *great listen. He explains just enough technical details to where someone with the ability to understand can go look up more info, but non-tech people can just follow along with the story and enjoy the ride. In my opinion, that's perfect."
11198,"If you  have to message a friend to ask how, you probably shouldn't attempt it."
11199,Yes
11200,Yes
11201,"I had to stop that episode halfway, it was too heart breaking for me."
11202,Awesome
11203,Is the format and structure the same as darknet diaries? I enjoy the story-telling aspect of darknet diaries but more enjoy the technical aspects and delivery of them.
11204,"I love his voice, but its personal preference I suppose."
11205,"I've run into this a few times, sometimes his voice can get a bit too.... whiny teenager-y for me? But fuck the man knows how to put together a story and tell it in a captivating way."
11206,"It is, yes."
11207,"I think it took like 30 something episodes before it had an actual darknet (drugs) topic. 

There's probably only 4 or so episodes, out of 130, that talk about darknet/drugs. There's a ton of cybercrime stuff, but more so on the hacking side of things. 

And lots of episodes about pen testers."
11208,Talk about ignorance
11209,Omg yyyeeeesssss! Thank you!
11210,"Yes, I stopped listening around the same time. Not because of quality at all, but because I had enough disease in my day to day life."
11211,I ended up taking a break then skipping most of the COVID episodes because the info was outdated by then and they had some terrible sound quality with most of the guests and I couldn't hear/understand half of what was going on. The non COVID episodes are great.
11212,Same! I listened nonstop until COVid hit then it just started to feel more political than factual.
11213,"> to wipe it on someone else's private parts I think, without them noticing 


Nooo omg "
11214,"Though I am sorry to hear you are going through that, I am also happy to hear you are in the process and hope that you receive the diagnosis fast!

This podcast really does open a person's eyes to not just the medical aspects and struggles, but also the human aspect - the mental, the emotional, the individual perspective that one does not see by just knowing about an illness or disease. I find with each podcast it gets better and touches on more than just the illness itself.

All my best to you "
11215,Thank you! I will definitely check it out
11216,The WWI one is one of the greatest pieces of media of all time. All of HH is amazing but the blueprint to Armageddon is transcendent
11217,"Am I the only one (in the US) who feels like they just totally skipped over this war in school? Like, Revolutionary war, Civil war, Reconstruction, World war II. Big gap in between."
11218,"Personally, I like Ghosts of the Ostfront even more. 

Blueprint to Armageddon is a close second for me though, definitely.

His short podcast on Lutherism was also really excellent."
11219,"I'm halfway through that one now, I'm taking my time listening to it because I don't want it to be over too soon. The fact that I'm saying that about a ~20 hour podcast series should be indicative of how good it is."
11220,What is this WWI series called?
11221,"You should check out the youtube channel The Great War. They went through the events of the war week by week in real time on the 100 year anniversry of the events they discussed. When I mean ""real time"" I mean each week when a new episode came out they would break down what had happened since that episode. As in ""For the week of april 3rd-10th..."" then they'd go over things like battles that occured, major troop movements, communications between world leaders, ect ect.. 

And between main episodes theyd do in depth spotlights on specific important people, battles, new pieces of technology, and more"
11222,"I'm a huge history buff and I'm literally listening to part 4 of that series. He's so good, I know a lot but the amount of detail is terrific. The rise of Japan in the Second World War was also brilliant."
11223,100% this. I had no idea the depths of awfulness. It changed my worldview.
11224,should have won a peabody or something. incredible story telling
11225,That series turned me into my dad.
11226,"I was gobsmacked watching Ken Burns' WWI. I kept thinking ""How did I not know this?"""
11227,"My great-grandfather was awarded the Citation Star (later the Silver Star) in WW1. The official records were lost in the National Public Records fire of 1973, but the family still has the award. We asked my grandfather about it once, and he said ""Oh, he and some buddies took a french village from some Germans."" 

I looked it up and I'm pretty certain that clever, complicated motherfucker was in the [Battle of Saint-Mihiel.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Saint-Mihiel#:~:text=The%20Battle%20of%20Saint%2DMihiel,United%20States%20against%20German%20positions.)"
11228,You really should check out the Great War channel on YouTube
11229,I can't find it. What is it called?
11230,I put the one about Genghis Khan up there as well
11231,"This. I was in the Marine corps for 8 years, and learned only slightly more about WWI then I had known before, which was gas and artillery.

This series is a monster, each episode is 4 to 5 hours and if I remember correctly there are six episodes. I listen to the whole series back to back three times after I first found it. It's absolutely incredible."
11232,I highly recommend the Genghis Khan episodes as well.
11233,The wrath of khans is just as good.
11234,What is the specific name of that one? Can't find it on the Apple podcast list
11235,"My issue is he gets a lot of basic facts wrong. His description of the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand is complete fiction and repeats the most common misconceptions about how it happened. I really don't think it's a good series if you actually care about what you learn being correct, though he does set the mood pretty well."
11236,What's the title to that one?
11237,"Yeah, that was an amazing listen. Dan knocked it our of the park."
11238,Absolutely mind blowing
11239,Which episode exactly is this on spotify? I can't seem to find it...
11240,Same here. After listing to Blueprint for Armageddon I went on a WW1 book  binge. Didn't like how little I knew and now believe most of the 20th century was shaped by this totally unnecessary war.
11241,Where is hardcore history available?
11242,"can't agree with this enough. The WWI series was the most amazing piece of audio I have ever had the pleasure to listen to. There aren't enough words to describe how fucking amazing Dan Carlin is, especially in that one. If I had 3 wishes one of them would be to forget that podcast so I could listen to it again for the first time."
11243,"I was listening to super nova in the east and I actually had to stop listening this one specific segment, which is something that's never happened to me before.  It seems that, for me, having children really opened me up to be more empathetic overall and I'm not really equipped to handle it."
11244,I'm new to podcasts. There is an app on my iPhone called podcasts. I can't find the WWI podcast series. Can you tell me what I'm doing wrong? Feeling like a moron here
11245,Yeah it's amazing.  I listened to it 3 or 4 years ago but I still think about it often
11246,Is behind paywall?
11247,"It's so so good. 

Took me into the meat grinder in the trenches"
11248,"Ghosts of the Ostfront and Supernova in the East are also very good.

As are the ones about Caesar and Hannibal."
11249,I say all the time that it's the highest achievement in the form of media. It deserves all the prizes it gets.  Change how you look at the entire 20th century.
11250,Human.meat.grinderrr
11251,"Is it the ""Supernova in East"" part, covering asia/pacific?"
11252,What's the title of the ww1 series?
11253,It went downhill after that.
11254,The first episode of that series  was the most perfect podcast episode be ever listened to
11255,Blueprint for Armageddon was amazing but I'm still a bigger fan of Wrath of the Khans.
11256,"What is the actual title of the series? I'd love to listen to this, but his titles aren't super obvious"
11257,I can genuinely say it changed my entire world view
11258,"I listened to the entire thing twice.  I've never been more rocked by history than that.  He deserves a goddamn award.

I remember being taught all about the major wars except WWI.  I knew next to nothing about it."
11259,"When he started rattling off casualty figures, I started blanking out my brain during that series.

I knew WW1 was bad, but battles which I didn't know much about (Frontiers and the first French offensive) had just shocking number of dead.  I think the French lost more in one day of their offensive than the British did during the first day of the Somme."
11260,"blueprint for armegeddon.

fucking amazing."
11261,That one and I loved the Fall of Rome one. I can't remember what it was called.
11262,don't sleep on Death Throes of the Republic or Punic Nightmares. Dan makes Roman history make sense and both series are riveting.
11263,"I know I know nothing. I know pretty much three things about WW1: The assassination of Franz Ferdinand lead to it starting, the Americans showed up near the end when the fighting was almost over, mostly so they could be at the the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, and the Ottoman Empire ceased to exist because of the war, but I don't know exactly how that happened or why.

I've also heard speculation it wouldn't be called World War 1 (and would have had a name like the ""Great European War"") if the US hadn't gotten involved, but I have no idea if that's true."
11264,"I agree.

I looked for it recently because I wanted to download it all for travelling without internet but couldn't get that series on my podcast app anymore"
11265,That podcast started an absolute WWI obsession for me and since listening to it I think I've probably read 50+ books on the topic
11266,"I read his source book after listening. ""A World Undone"". Its as dense as the podcast and three times as depressing. Millions died for absolutely no reason."
11267,"True, but I kept tuning Carlin out because it was ""back into the meat grinder"" any time he mentioned a battle. I preferred his series on the Mongols."
11268,"100%. I feel like it was taught to me as ""oh this war happened, but WWII was the real important one!"" Listening to his WW1 series was incredibly interesting, especially the discussion centered around how technological advances were butting up against military dogma and the sheer amount of lives that were taken."
11269,"Hey, thanks ! Do you know what episode number that might be? I'm old and can't work episode searches etc"
11270,"I highly recommend the book, ""the beauty and the sorrow"" that he pulled a lot of the quotes from. It is a genuinely interesting perspective to see the war humanized by seeing it through the eyes of those involved. I feel like most of the history books are about the battles and strategies rather than the actual people."
11271,Can anyone tell me or spotify link me to the episode numbers for this please? You've all got me curious!
11272,I finished listening last month. What a wild ride. I'm gonna listen to it again it's soo good.
11273,I feel like I took a college class on WW1.
11274,It's like 15-20 hours long and I've listened to it in its entirety three times.  It is absolutely amazing.
11275,I listened to it after visiting the WW1 museum in KC. Completely shook me.
11276,"I read about 10 books on WW1 after listening to the blueprint of armageddon. I highly recommend reading the Guns of August by Barbara Tuchman. If you liked the WW1 podcats, chances are that you'll LOVE that book."
11277,the meat grinder!
11278,Can you share the link? Want to make sure it's the right one.
11279,Sadly he's scrubbed it from most places. It's really hard to find the whole WW1 podcast
11280,Mongolians one was fantastic too
11281,"It's a good story telling, but not the most accurate. Go check out threads on r/history about Dan Carlin."
11282,"Growing up I was mainly focused on WW2, but after listening to that series, my eyes have been opened. You can't understand why WW2 happened without looking at WW1, the amount of destruction and death made WW2 look like light losses. Also it led to America becoming an economic powerhouse because all the wealth in the world was primarily in London, but people moved it over to the US for fear London would be captured by the Germans."
11283,"Hard agree, it was amazing"
11284,What's it called?
11285,I've considered purchasing this series so I can listen to it again. And I'm cheap AF with my media lol it's so good
11286,honestly nothing since has hit the same as those 6 hour long episodes
11287,"I've gone as far back as the Rome one, and everything after is just brilliant."
11288,"As a student of WW2 as presented by the history Channel and American popular media, The Ghosts of the Ostfront made me realize how little we know about Russias role in WW2."
11289,What's this episode called? Is it blitz the Destroyer of Worlds?
11290,"I swear it's been a decade since that was released and my husband STILL goes on tangents. As well as about Genghis Khan.

I've listened here and there and it is fascinating, but audiobooks/podcasts can't hold my attention. I drift into daydreaming everything."
11291,"I was shocked and dismayed at how little I knew about that war. It's always overshadowed by WWII, both because WWII more recent, but also probably because it's easier to see the ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys"". WWI was just a bunch of countries who didn't really want war, feeling obligated to go to war. Then the new technology made killing so easy, but no one was really able to gain an upper hand for years. 

It truly seems like the worst war in human history. Some of WWII gets close, like Stalingrad, or parts of the Pacific Theater, but in terms of the conflict on the whole, WWI is really unmatched."
11292,"Man, Blueprint for Armageddon should be required listening for anyone interested in European History modern history at all."
11293,"I listened to this one when I used to work in a bakery in University. I'd be up at 4am just baking bread listening to dramatic reads of WW1 letters from the trenches, it was surreal."
11294,"""Genghis Khan did some cold ass shit. And then he did it again. And again, and again. And then he did it again."""

11298,"Dan talking so I turn the volume up...

QUOTE

My car speakers shatter"
11299,"Sometimes I laugh to myself imagining Dan quoting some romantic poetry in that same tone he uses.  There's bits of the WW1 series where he's quoting what is clearly, to me, dry British sarcasm meant to raise a laugh but he does it in that consistent gritty quote voice of his."
11300,The description of the execution of the Anabaptists after the Munster Rebellion 
11301,"""can you imagine what that looked like?!"""
11302,Listen to Lions Led By Donkeys. It's much of the same.
11303,God the wuotes from the WW2 firebombing victims were chilling.
11304,Don't forget the signature pitch change in his voice. :)
11305,"""The Japanese are just like everybody else...only more so."""
11306,I get so so so excited when I get the notification that there's a new episode. I could probably do 2ish hours of his content per day if he was able to produce that much.
11307,I felt like it was the best college course I've ever taken.
11308,Where can you find the whole thing. Full show is not on apple podcasts and seems to be behind a paywall
11309,Has he done any of them since the Japan one?
11310,[deleted]
11311,He was better in the shorter episodes.
11312,"I always tell people about king of kings, because it's about 18 hours all in on the Persian empire and it's an hour into the first episode before he even mentions the word Persia because he's giving a background of the rest of the region!"
11313,"""Here I lie, Kurosh, King of Kings"". Sends shivers down my spine every time."
11314,He spends the beginning of it putting so much perspective on the world they lived in that's I never would've considered. Like I know the world was much more connected than we give credit for today but the idea that they were doing their own archeology and knew the world they were living in was ancient just strikes me as crazy to think about. It's hard to imagine since they were working off history that was almost entirely unwritten.
11315,"Strangely, the geography lesson I got while following along on Google Maps was just as valuable as the history lesson."
11316,Same! And that's saying a lot considering how long each series is.
11317,"I've really enjoyed his coverage of the earlier period but frankly it kind-of makes me feel dumb. Like  Japan, Russian, USA... ok I know the actors.  Babalon, Asseria, Medes etc... I always feel like I need a map and notes to follow what's happening."
11318,"The guy's dramatic delivery could make an insurance commercial interesting. He invests every sentence with life-or-death intensity and makes you care about stuff you never heard about before from centuries ago. 

And he revels in the descriptions of brutality and raw power, because that's just how it was back then."
11319,"What I like about Dan Carlin is that he goes in depth about the rise and the fall of states and people who end up as the ""bad guys"" in mainstream history takes."
11320,That was the first one I listened to. I'm hooked. I'm on supernova in the east 5 now.
11321,Lol I listened to this the entire plane ride during my first visit to Japan. Crazy how much the country changed post WW2.
11322,The part where he reads the accounts of people who survived the Firebombing of Tokyo and the Atom bombs was one of the hardest pieces of media to listen to. What that one woman went through with her family was devastating to even hear.
11323,"His most underrated series, in my top 3 for sure if not 2nd"
11324,I tried to listen to this one after reading recommendations but I just couldn't get into it.
11325,"Driving to work and listening to it right now, part 5"
11326,I couldn't get enough of it. Addicted to Bondage was great too.
11327,I always listen to it in like 2 days and then am so disappointed I have to wait months for another.
11328,Twice a year thou 
11329,I wish his videos were in order..?  They seem all over the place on YouTube on his channel
11330,"If you think this show is worth a dollar, Ben and Dan would love to have it. A buck a show! It's all we ask."
11331,_abuckashow_ is what the lady says.
11332,The opening monologue from that one gives me chills every time.
11333,"I've never heard of this show but I definitely want to hear the WWI stuff, but I can't see it on the podcast feed. What are the episodes called?"
11334,I am a huge nerd about nuclear weapons. I just find them fascinating. I've definitely listened to Destroyer of Worlds 5+ times. I love it.
11335,And what a title: Human Resources
11336,"I felt sick when he described the slave ships sitting off the coast of West Africa for months before even taking off. The journey on the sea was awful enough, but factor in those people just lay chained in the ships for months while they filled it up was crushing."
11337,It's probably one of the greatest pieces of audio media released in the last few decades.
11338,I would say reddit folk aren't your average bunch of people.
11339,It is on Reddit.
11340,They were talking about it on Last Podcast on the Left the Last few episodes. I was really surprised they knew it.
11341,Same
11342,Have to go to his website. Buck an episode.
11343,"They're all on Apple Music for free. I assume Spotify too, but I'm not sure."
11344,https://www.dancarlin.com
11345,"For example, about once and episode he straight up tells you that he's a journalist and not a historian, and reminds you to take everything he's saying with a pinch of salt."
11346,"For those that like dan carlin and hardcore history, strong shoutout for history on fire by danieli bolleli. His episodes on teddy roosevelt and joan of arc are some of my favorites."
11347,"Some hardline historians get a bit bent out of shape when he fills in some gaps or doesn't get a specific point 100% right. It's clear that Carlin does really put in the hard yards, though, to weave a cohesive narrative that is, for the most part, very accurate. He does a good job of cross-referencing sources to highlight potential biases (i.e. the trustworthiness of biographies or autobiographies)."
11348,"*Except* on boxing. That episode was just silly.   
   
But everything else is wonderful."
11349,I find it the reverse. I found Mike Duncan the one who sounds like history teacher trying to complete his job lecturing about an assigned topic. Dan Carlin's more like telling story instead of history. Maybe not as accurate but much more entertaining to me.
11350,"Agreed, Mike Duncan is amazing. Super detailed and easy to listen to."
11351,"The difference I find, having listened to HH and Revo. (not HoR) is that Duncan is just kinda... boring? Like, he I am sure is interested as he has a podcast about it (and I believe has a book), he is just dry as hell to listen to. Which in some ways is kinda an accomplishment; to make the storming of the Bastille dry for example."
11352,"I realize this is a podcast comparison, but.... Mike Duncan's ""The Storm Before the Storm"" is a very good book. However, Dan Carlin's ""Death Throes of the Republic"" series is a bit more enjoyable to me. Mike's book came out years later and adds relatively little new material of substance. Yes, there are more details laid out in a linear, organized, cohesive manner which plainly illicit parallels with the US and other countries of today. Dan's series does that as well. I ""read"" audiobooks almost exclusively so nothing to do with reading vs listening. I'll have to go back and check out Mike's podcast(s) again soon. I tried them in the past and stopped for whatever reason. But, it's like Christmas when a new HH episode comes out."
11353,Why else would you listen to a history podcast if you're not at least a little interested in the topic?
11354,"Thank you. Mike Duncan is palatable, non-cringe, and based af. Things I can't say about Dan Carlin"
11355,I'm on the same page. I listen to a LOT of podcasts but I cannot get into HH.
11356,"Nope, couldn't stand this podcast either despite all the raving reviews."
11357,"Agreed - I tried after seeing HH recommended very highly on here, and found it's one-note intensity detracted from the content (if everything is dramatic, nothing is dramatic).

On the other hand, I really like the Fall of Civilization podcast, which is so calm I use it to fall asleep (and then listen again during the day)."
11358,"""Now, this is a podcast that, and I am not exaggerating here, this podcast by Dan Carlin is THE, number 1 upvoted podcast on Reddit. And that isn't just on the podcasts subreddit. This is on /r/AskReddit, which has over, 40 million. That is over 40 million, that is more than the population of Canada, where Hardcore History is the top voted podcast.""

I generally like the podcast, but there are certain series where it seems there is far more theatrical filler than actual progression and insight."
11359,"You're not alone. I've tried almost as many times as I've seen it raved about here on Reddit, and I just can't get into it. I literally signed up for an Apple Music trial just now and tried to listen to Blueprint for Armageddon again after reading this thread and just couldn't hang. 

Maybe it's not a good example of his normal stuff but the first few minutes are just him pontificating and editorializing. It's great that he's passionate, but I really don't want a personal pov with my history. Just the facts please."
11360,Hardcore History has the most recent releases on all the podcast apps you check. The rest can be purchased from his website. https://www.dancarlin.com
11361,"He spends a lot of time pointing out that historians disagree on different points and how current thinking  has evolved over time, and seems to try for the current consensus or middle road of disagreements between different historians while clearly indicating where hes picking the ones that sound most likely to him. His sources are in show notes, and he cites them by name constantly throughout the shows. I've read some of his sources, and they're accurately quoted. I'm certain there are historians who disagree in their analysis from the historians he cites on any given subject, like any other science. 

However, I'm not sure what else could be asked of him beyond what he's doing. Perhaps fewer Star Wars and boxing analogies, but it is pop-history and designed to be entertaining.

What specifically did you find inaccurate?"
11362,"I'd be careful about the askhistorians posts regarding Carlin too, many of them do exactly what they accuse him of doing. They take bits of his podcast out of context and use it to construct a particular narrative. I remember one of their criticisms quoted a bit of one of his podcasts but conveniently left out the fact that prefaced the bit they quoted with a warning that the little side story he was about to tell was heavily disputed but he was telling it for entertainment value. And that's the thing with Carlin, he's not a historian he's an entertainer and he's completely honest about that. One of the main criticisms askhistorians has with him is that he can't help himself when it comes to interesting but dubious stories but the thing is when he tells a dubious story he's always honest about it. He has stated his main goal is to interest people in a topic and hopefully inspire them to read further and develop an interest in history and I'd say he's damn successful at that."
11363,"He's the Bill Simmons of history. A lot of guys know more about basketball/history, but most of them can't make a high quality and entertaining podcast about it."
11364,"He says that multiple times an episode. ""Now folks, I'm not a historian, I'm just a fan of history, but...""

It's less of a history podcast, and more of a Dan Carlin talks about history podcast. Ya feel me? There's a reason most history podcasts are small, and it's because history tends to be very dry. Dan has a way of spinning a narrative into what he talks about and entertains. 

When he talks about the Mongols, he's not going into it with the mentality of ""This will be the most historically accurate catalogue of Mongol History."" Its more of a ""I think the Mongols are really cool, so I wanna talk about them.""

I've seen some of the threads that you mentioned, and the consensus seems to be he does good podcasts, but he's an entertainer and not the arbiter of truth when it comes to history. So it's more cautioning people to not go to Carlin as the primary source for a historical topic. And I think even he would agree with that."
11365,People on reddit aren't always right either.  He's not a historian. He just relays what other historians have said.
11366,"I dunno, Dan did a AMA over there about 10 years ago (so like 6 episodes of his podcast) and got a quite positive response from most posters."
11367,[deleted]
11368,"One of the most upvoted comments in one of those ""Opinions in Dan Carlin?"" threads asserts he's a bad historian because he hasn't done a podcast on pregnancy.

Yeah, I don't take that subreddits opinion of Dan too seriously after seeing that."
11369,"I had the same experience with ""Painfotainment"" (historical torture methods) and ""Prophets of Doom"" (Anabaptists). Just...fucking brutal."
11370,"[Right here.](https://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/)

Recent episodes are available for free, and older ones are well worth the money as well, if you're interested."
11371,Revolutions should be essential listening.  If people only did The French Revolution and The Russian Revolution I feel the general level of political conversation would improve markedly.
11372,Revolutions is essential listening. Amazing work and a great synopsis of 19th/early 20th century Great Powers history.
11373,After more than 4 years of listening today I am finishing the final Revolutions episode and im sad about it 
11374,"Harry's razors

Also I have the Revolutions intro music permanently burnt into my brain now"
11375,"I have not listened to it yet, but it's on my list. I'm still working my way to the back catalog of. The Rest is History"
11376,"Try out Noble Blood! It's a historical pod that specifically talks about monarchs/rulers who met unfortunate or grisly ends. They're short too, like 25 minutes. The host Dana Schwartz is a great narrator."
11377,"I'm incredibly happy that Revolutions is getting mentioned twice in the top comments. Mike Duncan crams an immense amount of information into a very digestible format. 

The French Revolution, the Russian Revolution, and the revolutionary year of 1848 were my favorites. An amazing resource if you're interested in late 18th, 19th, and early 20th century Western political history.

Quick edit: I forgot about the Haitian Revolution. A shorter series than the ones I mentioned, but incredibly powerful. Especially if you grew up in the States, and had no idea about it because it was never covered."
11378,"It really gets going with the French Revolution. And the Haiti revolution is nuts, a must listen. And the Russian one is epic"
11379,the Chapo guys did a limited series on the Reformation and Thirty Years War and it made me re-start Revolutions
11380,"I wish I could get into this and History of Rome. For whatever reason, I just can't focus on the content. Idk if it's the production or sound quality, or just Mike's voice...but I have tried to listen and given up like four different times now and just haven't been able to do it. 

Is there a better ""diving in point"" than just the first episode(s)?"
11381,"Duncan is great. My only criticism is he insists on pronouncing plebs as pleebs. I'm not a Latin expert by any stretch, but I've never heard anyone pronounce or that way and it's always jarring. 10/10 otherwise"
11382,I second this. Excellent show.
11383,History of Byzantium is a direct sequel to Duncan's series. It will go all the way til the fall of Constantinople.
11384,"I briefly started it over again. It was pretty nice to start back at the tribal wars and the founding of the city and get a sense of the scope of the whole western Roman era.

Revolutions (Mike's newer podcast) and History of Byzantium (the unofficial sequel) didn't quite hit the same for me but are both presumably great."
11385,"I'm really enjoying Revolutions. It starts off as a bit of a slower burn with part 1, but I'm halfway through the French Revolution (part 3) and I'm enjoying it every bit as much as Rome."
11386,"You should try the British History podcast. Pretty much starts off with the Roman involvement in Britain and goes from there. Its way more in depth and he does a better job of creating a story from the history than Mike Duncan. It's taken him about 400 episodes to just get to the Norman invasion, so that gives you an idea of the level of detail he goes into."
11387,"Revolutions.  It's just as good once he gets into it.  English Civil War is a little rough, he hits a good stride with American Revolution and then starting with the French Revolution it's really off and running.  Don't worry about being close to done with Rome, you've got plenty left to go."
11388,"Mike Duncan has a follow up Series called Revolutions that goes over the major Revolutions of history, 1 per season.  If you ask me, it's even better than Rome.  Some of the most engaging and fascinating history and he's just so polished and experienced at the story telling at this point that it's almost impossible to stop listening.  In particular his seasons on The French Revolution, Mexican Revolution, and Latin American Wars of Independence are among the most riveting pieces of Hostory Media out there."
11389,"I recently caught up on History of Byzantium by Robin Pearson, so I relistened to History of Rome (been a few years!). I am really unsure which one I like better, Robin does a great job filling Mikes shoes"
11390,"Seconding the History of Byzantium podcast. It's mildly different, but really is a great podcast to continue that historical throughline."
11391,"Revolutions is a good place to go next, same author"
11392,"Not to discredit Mike Duncan in any way, but Wyman is actually a PhD historian which makes him more enjoyable to watch as a history student myself as he is more critical of his sources than Duncan is. Fall of Rome is also an excellent podcast (Wyman's)."
11393,"Thanks for mentioning this podcast. I feel like Robin does a great job carrying Duncan's work on, and got me interested in a segment of history I'd basically written off. Dude isn't Mike Duncan, but isn't trying to be, and does his own thing in a great way."
11394,At one point I had made a YouTube channel that would have his episode playing and I would use different art pieces + other pictures as a visual aid. There were quite a few fans of it but when I sent him a message I never got a reply back so didn't want to steal his audio.
11395,"The History of Rome is so captivating that though it is very long, I was so sad when it ended."
11396,"I hadn't listened to the Rest is History until a few days ago, and the banter around the Hundred Years' War is funnier than it has any right to be."
11397,"I also got into them recently (past year or so) and while I do love them,  if there's anything I'd have to complain about, it's gotta be their rigid timelines, and basically cutting off the guest, ignoring what they said to ask some random fan question, or go to a break. Again, I love them and I'm a big fan of the show, but I've been needing to vent about that. I just wish they'd let the show go on longer,  and allow some more conversation."
11398,Tom's Reagan is so goddamn funny lol
11399,"The crossover episode(s) with Dan Carlin are GREAT, unsurprisingly. Around episode 180-190 IIRC. Their discussion about the person who had the most influence on the 20th century was incredible."
11400,The one on King Tut is AMAZING
11401,The Dollop's episode on Reagan is much better. Must listen for any sane American.
11402,Surprised I haven't seen this sooner.  You're Dead to Me is my favorite history podcast!
11403,Great list of pods. Have you tried The Age of Napoleon?
11404,The History of the Germans by Dirk Hoffman is great. Listening to him criticize how the Popes destroyed the Glorious Holy Roman Empire was so cathartic.
11405,"Listen to Revolutions.  It's Mike Duncan's podcast where he covers different revolutions starting with the English Civil War and ending with the Russian Revolution.  A little shaky at first but there's some insanely interesting stuff in the English Civil War once it gets going, and after that the podcast is really off and running.  It becomes an excellent overview of the Long 19th Century so probably exactly what you're looking for."
11406,It's definitely surface level but they're good at hinting the points where you should do further reading if you're interesting. Also they do a really good job of showing multiple sides of the story so even though it's high level there's a lot of historiography in there.
11407,"Tom Holland is very much the definition of a ""pop historian"" ie someone more interested in reinforcing narratives they're attracted to instead of simply uncovering objective truths. This write up does a very good job of covering his methodology (or lack thereof):  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ig9vtw/what_makes_tom_holland_unreliable_as_a_historian/g2sqc4s

I could never make it more than a few episodes into The Rest is History. It's very odd how Tom presents himself as being the more left leaning pro-Labour personality but constantly has takes that are to the right of his Thatcherite co-host. But I suppose it's just a thing with that podcast network, on The Rest is Politics (which I do like quite a bit) the ex-Tory MP Rory Stewart is quite often to the left of Alastair Campbell on geopolitical & economic issues."
11408,No! It will always be downtown to me. Uptown still sounds so out of place.
11409,A friend of mine recommended this show and I only made it two episodes for this reason. I listen in the car while traveling (a lot) and I dislike taking my eyes off the road to skip through half of a podcast. Real shame cause I liked the content.
11410,"""Beautiful, downtown, Oakland California. """
11411,From the beginning or just jump in
11412,His Con Law podcast is great too!!
11413,People just type the podcast name and tell nothing about  it! Come on I came to find suggestions.... it's hard to get intrigued with no description
11414,and a great name
11415,I enjoyed the content but stopped listening because of his voice.  It has that whispering-too-close-to-the-mic ASMR quality that just sets off my misophonia.
11416,"Roman Mars is my #1, ""that's not what I thought you looked like based on your voice""."
11417,"I like the content, but he always sounds off-putting-ly smug to me."
11418,"His voice is why I never really got into it. I keep thinking ""is this podcast actually good or is it just his voice?"""
11419,"Design of things as a broad subject. 

They have had episodes about the first ambulance service in the US, clothing design, peat bogs as a carbon sink and how they are better than trees, the lottery, the bleep to cover profanity in tv and radio, homeless programs and subsidized housing, open spaces in the UK and how you can basically cut across privately owned land as a walker."
11420,"I just learned in a first aid course as well that all the ""typical"" signs of heart attack are actually just typical for men. Women's signs are a lot more subtle and therefore more likely to be dismissed."
11421,"Read the book for that one. It's super interesting, although does cause a bit of a feeling of despair"
11422,"I like 475 about how Sotheby's and Christie's had to rock-paper-scossors to win the right to auction millions of dollars of art.
I also liked 314 about the Interrobang.

Honestly they're all self-contained so a scroll through the descriptions and choosing whatever you find interesting works."
11423,"It's strong from the start, since Roman Mars has a career in radio and didn't need to learn the trade before the podcast got good.  
But the episodes are also self contained, so you can scroll through and pick some topics and titles that catch your eye to get started."
11424,A couple that really stuck with me were The Mojave Phone Booth (episode 202) and On Average (episode 226)
11425,"The mini stories that they do at the end of each year are great. Basically a bunch of topics that fit with the shows theme, but they didn't have enough to make a full episode about them."
11426,Listen to the one about how we communicate with future humans that nuclear waste is bad. Ep 114
11427,The one about the history of paramedics was great too.
11428,"I loved this podcast when the former guy was still in the White House. I still love it, but it was great legal analysis of all his shenanigans and almost in real time. I wish they posted episodes as frequently as before."
11429,"I keep thinking how great it must be to take professor Joh's class because she's really entertaining and articulate, and just by coincidence has a good podcast voice. Roman really lucked out having such a talented neighbor who was willing to teach us, too

I get a lot more excited about those episode drops than 99pi nowadays"
11430,Which town/episode is that?
11431,Yeah years ago it was much better. Higher production values too. Now it's hard to listen to since it is poorly structured and with too many ads.
11432,"I had this problem with the early episodes, but the later ones are longer."
11433,In a word: design.
11434,That series was a fucking wild ride.
11435,"> the first fitness influencer 

That's not Zyzz?"
11436,"Take a bullet for you, babe."
11437,Them reading that book it's one of the funniest things I've ever heard.
11438,A bear of a man
11439,"And his high school nemesis, Yard."
11440,"I've been listening to the Benathan Shapiro book episodes, and am greatly enjoying the peep inside the broken mind of Li'l Ben.   
 
I mean, the sheer skill with which they constantly shit on him as a writer is just...*chef's kiss*   

 
Also, the books he wrote about sex? Major serial killer vibes. Just saying."
11441,A bear of a man if I ever saw one...
11442,The bear of a man himself.
11443,Get this man a podcast for comma usage!
11444,The bear of a man?
11445,"You called? I was busy flexing on the mirror, and you can tell from the timbre of my voice that I'm a bear of a man."
11446,Do you know which episode this was pls :)
11447,It taught me how not to write
11448,I hear he's a bear of a man
11449,"""A bear of a man"""
11450,">This was the podcast, that taught me about Combat General Brett Hawthorne...

It royally upsets me that my book languishes in obscurity while Bench Appearo writes garbage and gets millions"
11451,"But you know who almost definitely has directly caused a genocide? The sponsors of today's show, Raytheon. Raytheon - buy yourself a knife missile."
11452,"You know who else has never caused a genocide? Blue Apron, at least outside of their specific island."
11453,I miss those Doritos days of summer.
11454,I prefer the Washington State Patrol.  Or gold.
11455,Fetch me my throwing bagels
11456,"God I love Robert's humor so much. Especially when he goes on a long tangent and then comes back with ""[Guest] h-h-how do you feel about [Insert Main Topic]"" 

It always catches me off guard "
11457,1 pump 1 cream!
11458,That's why I only eat Cool Ranch^TM Doritos^TM!
11459,The only thing keeping society from devolving into cannibalism.
11460,You know who else is extremely successful in alt-right grifting? The products and services that sponsor this podcast.
11461,"Hey Sophie, do you know who doesn't question their humanity? The fine folks at Raytheon."
11462,Nupirin: Little. Yellow. Different.
11463,Never caused a genocide *yet*. If Fanta can create delicious cocaine juice to fuel Nazis who knows what Doritos is capable of.
11464,ROBERT.
11465,.... probably.
11466,I read this in Roberts voice.
11467,Eating cool ranch on my break
11468,You wouldn't massacre people for a Dorito?
11469,What? We can't claim that Sofi?
11470,The stuff in that and the Dulles brothers episodes should be required learning for all humans
11471,"Never heard this podcast, but fuck Henry Kissinger. I just have a policy of saying that anytime he comes up."
11472,Good news! They just started a 4 parter on Josef Mengele...
11473,"I listen to podcasts while I get ready for work.

Screaming about how Henry Kissinger is actually a malevolent presence, and not actually human, while trying to do makeup, results in stabbing yourself in the eye with either eyeliner or mascara. 0/10 would recommend. 

How. Is. That bastard. Still. Alive."
11474,Just as well his childhood didn't affect him later in life.
11475,Yes and also the Clarence Thomas 4 parter. Both are just amazing.
11476,And a 3 part of Steve segal
11477,">!""war crime Forest Gump""!<"
11478,"Kissinger, the Facebook series and the crack cocaine series are masterpieces."
11479,"I'm a fan of the Dollop, so that was an ""in"" for me.

... Then I had to take a break."
11480,Omg that was epic
11481,He's about to turn 100 years old and in good health.
11482,"And yesterday Robert started a 4-parter on Josef Mengele, so BUCKLE UP."
11483,I'm on part 3 and am all ready sad the bastard is somehow still alive.
11484,"Dave Anthony and Gareth Reynolds from the dollop guest star. It's amazing, and Gareth Reynolds does damn fine stand up. Episode 12 is the the best first episode for a newconer."
11485,If you loved the kissinger episodes i highly recommend The Dollop. Its hosted by David and Gareth who were the guests on that episode and its some of the funniest stuff ive listened to.
11486,"Check out the episodes on Dr Kellogg as well, that dude was so fucked up. Corn flakes fucked up so many more peoples lives than you realized"
11487,Adding it to my list to listen to. How does it compare to the Clarence Thomas episodes?
11488,I'll finish part 6 on my commute today. Shit's wild.
11489,Kissinger : The Forrest Gump of war crimes.
11490,"If you listen to the Lions Led by Donkeys episodes on Cambodia, you get to learn the full aftermath Kissinger's bombing campaign led to. It's not for the faint of heart. Normally I'm fine hearing about history even if it's bad, but my blood pressure shot up considerably and I had nightmares for a few days after learning about Pol Pot."
11491,The nut huggers... The nut huggers
11492,How is the dog?
11493,Peak podcasting. I love it when my two favorite podcasts collide.
11494,"The one thing I regret about this 6 parter is that there's so fucking many genocides mentioned that I feel myself being less and less shocked throughout the parts

I don't think that's a good thing, but then again, brain's gotta cope, I guess"
11495,they just started a 4 parter on Josef Mengele and I'm betting it makes Kissinger seem light.
11496,"Kissinger is a great episode, as is the MK Ultra series, and the whole Cracktober/""CIA was importing cocaine into the US and flooded our city streets with crack to fund their overthrow of leftist revolutionaries under Reagan while also claiming to champion the war on drugs"" episode."
11497,"That episode series also introduced me to The Dollop, another wonderful history podcast. Dave Anthony and Gareth Reynolds have a great chemistry that was highlighted when they were guests on the Kissinger series with Robert"
11498,"I listened to this during a road trip to a family reunion and by the time I got there I was WORKED UP. My extended family is overwhelmingly conservative and I could barely stop myself from going off. 

Such a great series."
11499,Fuck 60 Minutes
11500,Only 6 episodes for Kissinger?  They must have missed some some stuff!
11501,"I was very disappointed to find that the [Henry Kissinger deadpool](https://henrykissinger.rip/) was filled until 2027 when I got my spot in. But if he dies on my wife's and my anniversary, we'll have all the more cause to celebrate!

You entered by donating to one of their listed charities. The person who successfully predicted the date of his death gets a bottle of booze from a bunch of countries he's had a hand in destroying."
11502,Want to run that by me again
11503,* reverend doctor billy wayne davis
11504,Agreed. He is probably my favourite guest.
11505,That ship has sailed.
11506,Oh my god the live show about sea monkeys had me DYING.
11507,OMG I miss him!
11508,"I had no idea he was on the show. Love that dude, his YouTube special is "
11509,"One of the few good guests, the rest of the guests he normally gets are insanely cringe."
11510,Yessss!!!
11511,"When I learned that the most recent episode I listened to was BWD's last, I lost all interest in the show for some reason. Haven't listened to any since."
11512,"He's too high, I reckon."
11513,And Katy and Cody are regular guests. You're in for a treat.
11514, *Welcome to the worst year ever...*
11515,He's running a new daily podcast called It Could Happen Here
11516,"Someone mentioned It Coul Happen Here, but it became a daily podcast. The first 10 or so episodes depict how Robert envisions a second civil war might go, and is great."
11517,Margaret is lovely to listen to. As guest and host.
11518,"My leading theory is that Cool People Who Did Cool Stuff exists so that Cool Zone Media fans (and Sophie) don't absolutely lose their minds.

Chillin' with Margaret, being inspired. The perfect chaser to whatever nightmare Robert has in store for us every week!"
11519,Good idea. I had to stop listening to BTB for the sake of my own mental health
11520,I also agree! Both of those podcasts are perfect and both hosts (Robert from Behind the Bastards and Margret from Cool People) are very well researched and absolute delights!
11521,Still a little depressing when you figure out how 90% of CPWDCS episodes end.
11522,"The episodes on the Rise of Spanish Fascism are essential listening. Should really be more thoroughly taught in schools. Truly the embodiment of Left vs Right and how sitting on the sidelines only helps fascists. Also El Fantastico, a black American who earned that nickname because he was fantastic at throwing grenades at fascists."
11523,Check out Cool People Who Did Cool Stuff to somewhat balance it out
11524,Next thing you know you'll be in a gun fight with the FDA.
11525,"The book he wrote, After the Revolution,  is also on Spotify and he narrated it himself. I listened to it recently and it's got a post apocalyptic western cyberpunk vibe if that's even a thing. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
11526,"Tbh, i like Robert, but find the whole episode is heavily dependant on the charisma of the co host. When he just has margeret or someone on it just tends to feel deflated and boring if co host isnt also in the know on the topic and just responding or affirming what he said the whole time instead of also joking or expanding the subject matter. Much more fun and interesting when both he and guest/cohost can just start ripping on stuff constantly haha."
11527,"Yeah also check out, it could happen here."
11528,And a total babe.
11529,"I love the topics, I love the content.  I don't love his stabs at humor."
11530,Would like to see him guest host the Daily Show.
11531,But he also sold dick pills during an episode on snake oil salesmen. He was literally selling pills to make your dick big while complaining about others who did the same thing and basically calling them bastards.
11532,"Robert Evans is an admitted agent of the federal government who helped spy on and entrap BLM protestors in Portland in 2020, which is really strange for someone who claims to be an anarchist. He makes 400k a year, also strange for an anarchist

If you want a podcast with similar content as BtB but not run by a fed whose job is to help the FBI entrap left wing activists is recommend Programmed to Chill and Subliminal Jihad"
11533,"Just listening to the Alex Jones update episodes. It's fun flipping the format and having the guests be the experts and Robert the ""audience"" who gets to react to the wild shit."
11534,"Speaking of podcast friends of Dan and JORdan, I wonder if they'll ever address what has happened over at *Opening Arguments.* I found OA through KF, and used it to detail my knowledge of the Jones trials, as well as several others. The ""expert"" half of the host team has been up to some shady shut, though, and they lost their comedic half. The pod has def suffered, but it's going to be difficult to listen, knowing what the other guy has been up to."
11535,"> Steven Seagal for heaven's sake!! I bet that one is fantastic!

Absolutely 100% one of the best episodes."
11536,The Birth of American Fascism 3-parter is... eye-opening to say the least
11537,"Rush limbaugh, the business plot, kissinger, the illuminati, Clarence Thomas, LRH"
11538,That could end up rivaling the Steven Segal episodes!  That will be really good!
11539,Has it been announced? Because I would totally listen to that.
11540,He's gotta have Dan & Jordan guest for that one!
11541,"If you like The Dollop, the 6 part series on Henry Kissenger where they guest is amazing. 

If you don't like The Dollop, the 6 part series on Henry Kissenger where they guest is still amazing."
11542,"George Lincoln Rockwell for a serious subject

Libertarian seasteading for a lighter subject"
11543,John Wayne
11544,"My personal favorite was ""Priests of Plague."" It was about how organized religion usually prolongs or makes pandemics worse."
11545,"Ronald Reagan, Steven Seagal, and Clarence Thomas are all wild"
11546,Tsar Nicholas II
11547,"If you haven't heard it, you should try Asshole Court. Similar concept but a lot more entertaining, in my opinion.

Might just be called AHCPodcast these days but not sure."
11548,"You fool, your mistake was having any fate to begin with!"
11549,"Maybe try listening to it's sister pod Cool people who did cool stuff, if btb gives you depression then that ought to help"
11550,Glad it's not just me. I went through a phase where I listened to this a lot but eventually the hosts really started getting on my nerves and I had to stop.
11551,"Ok good.

I thought I was the only one who hated the cadence of the show. WAY too much weak humor and rambling. It feels like I'm hanging out in discord with a slightly annoying group of college-age guys playing a video game.

Everyone else I hear talk about the show thinks it's one of the best podcasts."
11552,Yeah it's like if you took the annoying smug attitude of a typical /r/bestof post and put it on a podcast.
11553,I see it often recommended and every time I try I just can't get into the host's sense of humor. I like the historical content and if they would have different hosts I would support it.
11554,"My only pet peeve is the heavy sighing that happens... a lot.  When he does get into serious analysis mode, it's great and I really think that's his strength.  Just a personal thing, reminds me too much of drunk college talks and in hindsight those were kinda eh."
11555,It's definitely an acquired taste
11556,"I like Robert, he's actually been all over and knows what he's talking about. I can't stand *any* of his guests or cohosts. They all seem to lean into the whole ""sarcastic beleaguered millennial"" thing way too hard and respond to everything with a heavy sigh. If it were just Robert talking, I'd listen to it more often."
11557,Yes! I've enjoyed the subject matter but Robert's sense of humor is absolutely grating.
11558,One of the biggest victims of COVID
11559,Maybe you should take a trip to the Blue Apron island and hunt some humans to take the edge off. (Running bit)
11560,You mean the guy from Letterman?
11561,"Yeah that episode was a doozy, I believe I only liked the part with the pencil, the rest was just so horrifying"
11562,The guests havent been great recently. Robert can be hilarious at times but he needs guests who are funnier than him.
11563,"They're VERY hit or miss. At this point when I'm in the mood for this specific podcast, I just scroll until I see one with Jamie Loftus as co-host"
11564,I like Matt lieb and mr peanut butter. Chelsea manning was super smart.
11565,Listen to the Reagan episodes with Patton Oswalt.
11566,"Agreed. I don't remember the name of any of the guests, but a lot of the time they were so aggressively unfunny that it was just cringey to hear them try to play along with jokes or bits."
11567,Jason Pargin is pretty cool. He's interesting and writes pretty dang good books!
11568,"I can barely believe the Clarence Thomas story, and it's not nearly over."
11569,"Curious to know what the subject was. I've also caught a few inaccuracies but figured I'd just treat it as entertainment and fact-check.

Robert's legitimately a great journalist for whom I have immense respect. But two shows a week and all that reading and writing, plus then putting on a comedy podcast, he's bound to get stuff wrong. I've found he's usually more accurate than The Dollop. I love that podcast too but it needs to be treated as entertainment."
11570,This was me with john Oliver. He did one on a subject i was very familiar with. The truth stretching and context omissions were egregious. It put a bad taste in my mouth.
11571,He usually at least throws disclaimers out and tells you sources. Definitely paints narratives based on nuggets but a lot of times those nuggets are there for entertainment and are inconsequential. Its certainly editorialized and not meant to be taken as a nuanced and accurate history the entire time.
11572,"This is literally everyone that covers lots of different subjects because no one has time to do PhD for every single episode. 

It's Knoll's law of media accuracy: everything you read in the newspapers is true, except for the story you happen to have first hand knowledge of."
11573,"Still curious what you were educated about and what was made up.  You referenced it but never replied to anyone or stated it, just seems like a lie."
11574,"They're not bad but it's definitely entertainment, and they don't really do a deep dive on stuff. I put this into like third tier podcast like when all the other ones I like I listen to this one."
11575,"Same thing happened to me.  I listened to about a dozen podcasts and thought it was amazing until I came to one where I knew the subject matter fairly well.  I knew the podcast was biased I just didn't realize how biased it really is.  There is definitely room for someone to do an objective analysis on some of these ""Bastards"" but I don't think it would be as popular because it would not be as salicious!"
11576,"Agreed, they have some loose qualifications, mostly anyone who isn't a full on anarchist is problematic."
11577,I don't think he paints himself as a reliable narrator at all though...  I don't listen to BTB for historical accuracy I listen to it for entertainment.  It seems like the problem was you were trusting him because you liked what he said until you didn't not that you were trusting him because he should be trusted.
11578,"Maybe provide an example, assclown?"
11579,"Exactly this

He finds himself so amusing that he forgets about the audience. 

Again, in my opinion, the vast majority of his jokes fall completely flat and are timed incredibly poorly - they completely interrupt the momentum of the narrative."
11580,"I find that, given the dark subject matter, the bad jokes make for much-needed levity"
11581,"Yeah the whole point of the jokes is to be flat and badly timed. Not the kind of humor everyone enjoys, but very much intentional."
11582,Listen to his novel. It's actually pretty dope. Robert Evans
11583,"Be aware though, it gets deeply nihilistic and depressing at points when you wouldn't expect it.

Mostly due to John Green's personal sense of nihilism and depression being expressed in his art.

However, because of that, it's genuinely amazing. I've cried more than once at it."
11584,He's a very gifted writer
11585,"If you haven't listened, Hank and Katherine's podcast is great too. I wouldn't say it's a good podcast, but literally every episode makes me have a good giggle."
11586,Ha.  I expanded the comments to see if anyone had made this recommendation.  We have the same taste.
11587,The Memory Palace is a great storytelling. Very evocative.
11588,"""Googling Strangers"" makes me cry every time"
11589,Auld Lang Syne fucks me up every time.
11590,"The seeds one pops back into my head every once in a while and yes... It's an amazing podcast and I tell everyone they need to listen to this and/or read the book, even if they are not normally John Green fans since they automatically jump to his fiction. It is so different than that."
11591,five stars
11592,almost everything from him and his brother is fucking _fantastic_
11593,"The podcast came before the book. The book is a collection of some of the essays he wrote for the podcast. I much prefer the podcast, it's more evocative to hear him narrate it."
11594,"Oh man I read the book about this by survivor Nando Parrado, very intense"
11595,"I was doing dishes listening to this one and I actually had to stop, dry my hands off, and let myself have a good cry. The specific part that got me was when they commented on how many terrible things happened in rapid succession and they couldn't catch a break. Something like ""This is like the movie The Land Before Time! How many terrible things are going to happen to these sweet little babies in this one movie?!"" 

Idk why, (maybe being an 80's baby and felt the gut punch of that movie as a kid), but it summed up my feeling perfectly. I was so emotionally invested in the story of these people who are so much more than a few details that the media exploited. I'm grateful they took the time to focus on their bravery, ingenuity, and heart, where so many other accounts are just interested in what they were forced to do to stay alive. 

This was a standout exceptional episode and it brought me back after I'd wandered over to other channels the past few months."
11596,This one had a literal jumpscare.  I never felt more in suspense while sitting in traffic.
11597,"Sarah has such a loving kindness towards humanity, I really love and appreciate her nuanced take on things. And Blair really brings the best out of her in the episodes she guests on"
11598,Is this the same incident from the movie Alive? Haven't seen that since the '90s but remember it being pretty good.
11599,Omg that's my favorite one and Sarah really needs to do more like this one. Lately she's been going off the rails/off topic in the episodes and they get pretty dull pretty quick.
11600,The book is a must read. Alive by Piers Paul Read
11601,"Maybe the only episode to get my heart racing/breathless? Also agree on the elements of humor so it's not all dark depression. 

The Chris McCandless episode (similar about survival) was really informative too. But they're all great. Patreon is worth it for them."
11602,"No joke, I've listed to this episode maybe 3-4 times. Even though I know the story by heart already, Sarah and the guest are such good storytellers! It's almost like re-watching a favourite movie."
11603,Literally just listened to that episode. So good.
11604,I wish the writers of Yellowjackets had listened to this episode.
11605,Another podcast about this: The Wild Project episode 179 is an interview with survivor Carlos Paez. It's in Spanish but is not too hard to understand - I listened to it to help me learn Spanish.
11606,"That one was just insane, dark, yet wholesome"
11607,Which episode is this? I can't seem to find it.
11608,That's what Yellowjackets is loosely based off of.
11609,Which episode is this?
11610,"Oh man, do you happen to remember this episode?"
11611,Yeah I've barely listened to any episodes since he left.
11612,I miss his dynamic but his new podcast Maintenance Phase has really brought into focus that his research and understanding of data needs scrutiny.  His credibility really dropped for me while Sarah stays radically empathetic and researched.
11613,"Me too, he was great in it and they a had good dynamic on mic.

I'm still deeply embarrassed about how long I thought Michael was a black woman. That was a huge wake up call for me personally about not assuming anything about people based on their voices. Also somewhat ironic considering the name of the show."
11614,"I don't even know that it's great anymore. I ended up unsubscribing a few months after he left. Sarah seems unable to distinguish between factual and emotional interpretations of events.  She also, at the time I stopped listening, kept doing multi-part series podcasts and then seemingly getting bored of the topic and never concluding it."
11615,If you miss him check out Maintenance Phase! He's in it and it's about health/diet/food debunking.
11616,"He's started two others that are even better, imo.

Still debunking and talking shit, just with a narrower focus"
11617,"S Town pissed me off to no end. 

>! I felt like a guy heard of a mystery, solved absolutely nothing, gave us no closure and essentially just let listeners peep on the lives of exploited poor rural folk for no benefit to them at all. At the end of it I was like ""okay so that just felt like I went home for a weekend and took my hipster friend and then he retold the story on his podcast because it was such a bizarre world to him. !<"
11618,You might like American Hysteria it's analysis of the history and conditions that caused American social panics and hysterics
11619,"I think the Hollywood episodes are meant to be lens through which we can examine media's interpretation of events, and culture at large. Starlets like J Simpson and Anna Nicole were victims of tabloid/reality show abuse and everyone cheered. Media like that influences day-to-day behavior of average people. I know blondes that *still* don't wear pink because they don't want to be perceived as a ""bimbo""."
11620,"I dunno. How bummed would you be if you hosted a podcast for years, and it was almost exclusively about all the worst panics in America? I like the fluffier episodes because I like to think it's a mental break for the hosts. You need that stuff sometimes, and it means the podcast goes on longer because the hosts don't want to pitch themselves off buildings."
11621,"Behind The Bastards may scratch that itch for you. They've done some hollywood people too, but it's always either really funny or they've done horrific crimes. When it comes to Steven Segal, it's both!"
11622,Yeah like the Jessica Simpson stuff. I didn't care about her in the early 00's and I care even less about her now.
11623,Maintenance phase and If books Could kill now!
11624,:(
11625,">Hello Internet is in in~~de~~finite hiatus

ftfy"
11626,I tell people to start with movies they've seen and like
11627,"Thanks! I love the film The Searchers and had queued that up for my first episode, but guess I'll skip it and try another instead"
11628,I've been interested in this podcast for a while and I'll follow your guide thank you so much !
11629,I just checked out your episode guide. That is awesome my friend
11630,"I was honestly kind of bummed that they finally found the One Ring and they didn't even know they had it. Fortunately Paulo has said that he continues to hide universe breaking artifacts in his games, just not the One Ring anymore."
11631,Someone posted them in a recommendation thread super early on (early 2016 when they had less than 5 episodes out) and I immediately knew I had to listen to it
11632,Check out Dungeons and Daddies!
11633,"Rude tales of magic is a ton of fun! I've also enjoyed their star trek themed spinoff, oh these those stars of space."
11634,I love Naddpod! Was scrolling through looking for it!
11635,Seconding Dungeons and Daddies. Love it so much I've listened to it several times through and subbed to patreon - which I literally never do.
11636,"Honestly, it's actually brilliant. I am in stitches when I'm listening to it"
11637,An actual play based on the music of The Decembrists? That is so far up my alley I can't believe I haven't heard of it yet!
11638,Lol there's a good counterpart on to that too although they're totally unrelated. It's called the real housewives of dungeons and dragons.
11639,"They don't really hit their stride until around the Frozen/Jaws/Oz stretch. I still like the early episodes, but I usually recommend that people start with some later ones."
11640,I just finished listening to that.
11641,Love Radio Rental! The Host is Rainn Wilson (Dwight from The Office.) The stories are eerie and mysterious but really cool! Wish there were more episodes.
11642,"Good God, yesterday I listened to the one where the guy got her copper iud stuck in his dick and a guy in the audience listening to the story passed out. I had to bend over and take a breath myself.

Unrelated to that story, Risk! Frequently makes me cry but in a good way"
11643,"I never came across this one, if you happen to know the episode number please tell me."
11644,That kid isn't his is my guess
11645,Reminds me of a Black Mirror episode with Jon Hamm
11646,Yes. The first one I listened to was about a brutal bear attack. Cannot believe the guy survived.
11647,Right? All of them are really interesting! Some more intense than others.
11648,The same thing happened to me! I binge a few episodes every few days and that's usually enough time for me to bounce back hahaha
11649,Just here to say the memory palace is an incredible work of both history and art. If all history text books were written by Nate we'd be so much better off.
11650,"I follow both of those too, intriguing stuff!"
11651,"They're first person accounts so each episode has a different voice as a real person tells their story. For example in the recent five part limited series about a mass shooting, there was a man who was shot and his wife killed, a woman whose grandson was orphaned, a teacher at the school, a man who went into the school when he heard there was a gunman, and the shooter's sister. It's extremely well done."
11652,"Dude, I've been binging, and I just listened to her story yesterday. That was mind-blowing."
11653,"Circling back around to comment on this. I so appreciate her telling her story. I love TIAH -- As a medical student I find it valuable to listen to stories like hers while paying attention to what that person's experience is with the medical system, what worked well, what was missed, and what could have gone better."
11654,"I feel like it's not even remotely like This American Life (but I do really enjoy both). TAL has conversations and is more light-hearted overall, even with tough topics."
11655,"and The Moth, for short stories. I love these kinds of podcasts, glad to add more to my list."
11656,I can't believe that I had to scroll this far to find Ologies!  Alie Ward does such a great job of asking experts entry-level questions without it seeming pandering.  It's the podcast I listen to as soon as it drops.  The bats episodes!  The hagfish slime!  What's not to love!!
11657,"Completely Arbortrary is such a fun show considering the premise is two guys talking about a tree every episode.

I do find they have a few inaccuracies here and there when they go outside of tree stuff because neither of them are formally-trained scientists. (Plus they sometimes veer a little closer to naturopathic pseudoscience stuff than I'd like.) But overall just a fun chill vibe to learn about some trees and introduce new concepts for you to look up."
11658,"They also occasionally go to see ""Sweary"" kerry & delve into project camelot."
11659,"It's also a surprisingly good indicator of shit you might expect to see pushed in the mainstream. Through my own projection, I think most people I know irl who would call themselves conservative would never identify with Alex Jones and think he's a fucking lunatic, and they'd be right. Where they would be wrong is how often fringe ideas that start in places like him become mainstream conservative talking points that those same luke warm conservative pick up. If I hear something from Jones through Knowledge Fight, there's a solid chance I'll hear it out of the mouth of somebody I know a few weeks later. It's really unsettling."
11660,"While the focus is on AJ and the Infowars stable of shithead miscreants, they do go down the woo woo trail with Project Camelot and some other weird assholes. (LIONEL!!!!)"
11661,"I just want to reiterate the level of entertainment represented here.

This dude is telling you to go listen to a series of podcast episodes that are basically mystery science theater...of a lawsuit deposition. A fucking deposition. I'm not sure I've ever laughed as hard as I did a these episodes, and again, it's about a deposition. Depositions are almost universally the most boring shit in the world. The knowledge fight guys are just awesome."
11662,"One of my favorite things ever was the Texas deposition with Alex episode, followed by the archives episode when Alex interviewed Bill Ayers."
11663,Do people not do that?
11664,"i'm in the low 400s right now, but i'm also listening to new eps. something about Dan and JorDan just fits in my head, even if it's featuring as miserable a prick as jones"
11665,"I do this too! I started listening to My Favorite Murder in January this year, and am only sad that I waited so long. I found that I had to stop and check back in with my other podcasts, whose entire back-episode-log I had already been through, because I was getting behind. So I have been doing MFM in 100 episode chunks (not counting the weekly mini-sodes, which technically make it 200 episode chunks) and then resurfacing to catch up the other shows, before plunging back in again. I just got to their first episode of 2020 today, and I'm curious to see how their response to the pandemic was."
11666,I'be kept up with the new episodes since I started listening a year and some change ago. I'm only on episode 184 of the backlog. I was listening to them for about 8 hours a day for like a month straight while at work. I'm going to be long dead before I catch up.
11667,That's what 2x speed and obsessive listening is for! GL!!
11668,It took me two years of listening to multiple episodes a day.
11669,Recently did several 12 hour drives. Knocked out only a few episodes haha
11670,"I listened to all of knowledge fight within six months of discovering it back in 2020. Spotify told me I had listened to over 50,000 minutes of it at the end of the year "
11671,I envy you. I found out about them from Cognitive Dissonance in 2019 the back catalog was huge even then.
11672,"I thought about doing it that way, but I assume most episodes are centered around current events and kind of not really engaging several years later. 

I started just listening to episodes as they come out back when they went on Behind The Bastards to talk about the depositions and I've really been enjoying that. Definitely tides me over between Bastards episodes."
11673,I started in late 2020/early 2021 and it took until May of 2022 to get caught up. Staying caught up isn't that hard but it was a large task getting to that point.
11674,">4 hours a day

Now, how could you possibly only listen to one episode a day?

I kid, but God, sometimes the episodes get *long*, and those are usually some of the best and in-depth."
11675,"Brilliant. I listen to podcast for probably 10 hours a day, I have an earphone in all the time in work and rarely get disturbed. I only really started to listen to them regularly about 3 years ago and I've already got 5 or 6 podcasts that I'm fully caught uo on and just waiting for the next episode every week. Finding a podcast with a 10 year back catalogue that I enjoy is always a great feeling"
11676,"Been binging since last August when they were on Majority Report, just hit the 700s"
11677,"Same here, I've managed to get through 150ish episodes already and I'm like ""cool, only 600 more to go."""
11678,I was doing the same thing but I decided to start listening to the new episodes as they come out along with the older ones.
11679,I'm almost caught up after a year. The fact that both Jordan and Dan *explicitly* warn their listeners not to do so for mental health reasons probably only encouraged me 
11680,You're gonna be waiting a long time for Lebron James to show up in the NBA
11681,"I like to listen to old episodes for several days, then one day a week catch up on the newer ones. That way i get to stay in the loop about whats happening now but also get the refresher on what happened in the past. I took a break from them but i think its time to go back..."
11682,It's so well researched that the attorneys for the families in the Alex Jones defamation cases actually spoke with the hosts and at one point had them crowdsource clips of the show while the trial was happening to show that he should have been present.
11683,[deleted]
11684,"While I do like their systematic analysis and great deconstruction of conspiracy crap, after listening to them I just Realized it was putting more of that shit in my brain/life.

And I just hate that crap.  I didn't want more of it.  So I had to stop listening to them."
11685,The summer of mustards!
11686,I need money!
11687,Dan and...Jordan. I am sweating!
11688,That intro is fire. Sometimes I play an episode just so I can listen to it again
11689,"And all the one off remixes, 551, 666, 712, 739"
11690,Jar Jar Binks has a Caribbean black accent...
11691,I DON'T WANNA HATE BLACK PEOPLE!
11692,I'm *SWEATING*!
11693,"HE'S A LOSER LITTLE, LITTLE TITTY BABY!"
11694,That's not even physically possible for a single humanoid.
11695,"Well, this is going on my list. Thanks stranger."
11696,"He's at home in our hearts. 

Also Dan refuses to cover that because he's prettier sure he's a fan and he doesn't want to encourage people messing with Kerry."
11697,Yeah it sucks because Dan and Jordan are phenomenal but once I hit the episode where they played a clip from Nick Fuentes I had to call it quits bc I was shaking with rage
11698,"At an avid fan of the show, that's fair. I can't drive with my windows down anymore because people can't think I'm listening to Alex jones."
11699,"Matt is great when he's given the opportunity to really let loose with his wit and humor. I highly recommend the horror podcast he co-hosts, ""With Gourley and Rust."" It took me a while to get used to Paul Rust, but I like them both. They go off on tangents like no other podcast.

I'd start with the Friday the 13th episodes, if you're a fan. Gourley's ""southern attorney"" bits are worth the listen alone."
11700,I want to pay Sona to follow me around all day and laugh. Her laughter is perfect.
11701,"Man, there's an episode where Conan is shitting all on Sona and her work ethic, then turns to Matt and is like ""and Matt, you're doing a great job, keep it up."" And Sona just goes ""what the FUCK"", so immediately pissed off lmao. Their infighting is my favorite."
11702,"My only gripe with the podcast is Sona's fake laughing. I really hate it and it was really bad early on and once you notice it, that's all you hear. Thankfully it's pretty much gone now since they've switched studios and got much more professional, either they are removing it in editing or had her stop it.

They even discussed her laugh in a earlier episode and she was like (paraphrasing) ""nah I fake laugh all the time. You'd know if I was laughing for real, but most of the time it's fake."
11703,You need to listen to the first Timothy olyphant one and the first Jeff Goldblum. Absolutely incredible.
11704,"Fly on the wall with David Spade and Dana Carvey is pretty damn close for me. Also Mallwalkin with Gourley is pretty fuckin funny too, but it is not informative in any way whatsoever. Comedy bang bang too if you enjoy improv and random characters"
11705,"ive been skipping the fan episodes for so long until i saw a clip on yt, now making my way through the back catalogue of those. it doesnt seem to matter the fan's personality type, Conan makes it interesting every time."
11706,"Conan is such an underrated interviewer. I watched him every night when he was on NBC for like 15 years. He was the absolute best at making a person you've never heard of into a hysterical, memorable interview. He asks such great and silly questions that it would just always lead to comedy. No one else made the interview section of their late night shows more entertaining, imo."
11707,"I actually do the opposite, only listen to the random people episodes because I find those more interesting than the celebrity ones."
11708,"This is how I feel about Pete Holmes podcast, You Made It Weird. He's such a funny goofball but also asks some of the most insightful questions that no one else would ask people. Even if I have no idea who the guest is, I always come away with something."
11709,You can check out Never Not Funny. A great podcast and Jimmy Pardo used to open for Conan. He's had him on the podcast a few times.
11710,Been a huge fan of CONAF since it began but recently found How Did This Get Made and I find the 3 hosts are just as funny if not more at times. Team Coco for life though.
11711,"> This is my top comedy podcast, I can't find anything that even compares

I agree CONAF is among the best for sure, but I can give you a few other comedy podcasts to check out if you'd like! Long story short: I went through some tough times (as we all did) during Covid and found myself looking to comedy podcasts to make me laugh. I did such a deep dive that I found some real gems.   


The Honeydew with Ryan Sickler - great stand-up comedian podcast where Sickler, who is a wonderful interviewer in his own right, talks to people about some of the worst experiences of their lives and they make light of it.   


Sunday Papers - features standup Greg Fitzsimmons and comedy writer Mike Gibbons, who release one episode each Sunday where they go over the headlines and make jokes about each one. It's divided into sections just like a newspaper as well (Headlines, Sports, Obituaries, Funnies, etc). This has become a favorite of mine.  


We Might Be Drunk - standups Mark Normand and Sam Morril drink a different cocktail each episode and interview other comedians/celebs. If you appreciate the art of standup, this is a must. It can definitely venture into the more degenerate/risque areas, but if you're comfortable with dark humor it's a fun listen."
11712,"This. For comparison, Andy Richter has interesting episodes but it can't hold my interest like Conan does."
11713,"I love the podcast and have to completely disagree with you. 

He is an awful interviewer. He can't be serious, he has to take the focus back into himself, he constantly talks over the guests, he repeats Matt's bits but louder to make them his joke.

And it's freaking great. But this is not really an interview show. It's a way for Conan to riff with people he enjoys. The times he goes into real depth are rare."
11714,Same.
11715,I honestly like the fan interviews even more than the celebrity ones. Everyone who calls in is interesting and Conan can pull the funny right out of them.
11716,Not to mention the contributions of Matt and Sona.  The three of them are hilarious together and clearly having a great time.
11717,Some of the best ones are the fan episodes.
11718,"""I announce today that I'm resigning the Presidency, to be in a production of Rent! Bluhuhuhuhuhuhuhu "
11719,His and Bill Burr's Kennedy bit about banging Monroe had me in tears.
11720,"I remember laughing hysterically at him impersonating fat Gerald Ford and him just yelling ""BEHOLD ME!"" So many great random bits"
11721,"Matt Gourley is also absolute gold and a perfect foil for Conan. Whatever that Sexman's Leap thing was a couple episodes ago was hilarious fodder.

Andy's absolutely sharp as a tack, but always kept himself to legendary one-liners on the show. Jordan Schlansky was weird and a great foil for Conan rants - but he just sorta sits there and takes it.

Gourley can hold is own with one-liners, but where he really sets himself apart is that he can hold up to Conan's goofball horseshit and often ""Yes ands"" his crazy historical references. They were made for each other."
11722,I love hearing stories about him and why he was picked to host a talk show. Basically he was an unknown they picked cuz he was constantly making everyone in the SNL writers room laugh. Same thing with the simpsons. I love hearing stories about his time there cuz he is with legendary writers and they all talk about how for the brief time he was there he was the funniest person in the room.
11723,"I like hearing about his past and stuff relating to his time working on the simpsons. I recently listened to one where he talks about coming up with the monorail episode. great podcast, some episodes are slower than others but most have made me laugh and break up my other pod casts on the days i dont have new releases to listen to"
11724,Bahahaha brilliant. I cried laughing at Amanda Seyfried's rendition of Elizabeth Holmes' voice and Conan from the 90's seducing each other
11725,I loved his interview with Jack White! Its an hour long but flys by.
11726,When he did the unsexy reading of 50 Shades of Grey I fucking lost it and I've listened to that clip like 50 times. (At the end of the Michael Che ep from 2020-08-24)
11727,"the guy is a master at making every question serious yet have a blanket of comedy in it. The fact that he's making fun of the situation actually drives the point home more often than not.

&#x200B;

Its like a horror movie doing a better job explaining the nuances of a tricky comment on society than an actual TV-broadcast style interview with an expert on the topic"
11728,The Stephen Colbert episode is probably my favorite episode of any podcast ever. A close second is Marc Maron interviewing Barack Obama on *WTF*.
11729,"The Colbert episode is great. I was surprised by how funny it wasn't, considering how funny both Conan and Colbert can be. But I was equally surprised by how much I enjoyed listening to the two of them talk without needing to throw in a punchline every 10 seconds."
11730,The story about the ski lift and the Doritos...
11731,"The Kevin Nealon episode is absolute nonsense from beginning to end. You get to the end of the episode thinking ""what the hell just happened?"" but also ""that was the most hilarious 90 minutes of my life"""
11732,"""we're gonna take a quick commercial break""..."
11733,"That newest one I've heard and watched several times. Really made me laugh so many times.

The recent one where Billy Eilish asks Conan to scream as loud as he can was also so funny and silly, Finneas almost choking was hilarious."
11734,"Top 3 favorite right here. Him, Shaq, and Jim Gaffigan"
11735,"Yeah, I listened to it twice or even thrice because their chemistry was pure joy."
11736,"I dream of one day kidnapping Conan Obrien, Kevin Nealon, and Jeff Goldblum, and locking them in a sound booth for 24 hours."
11737,Both KN and Charles Barkley had me on the floor.
11738,It's Sonya. That killed me.
11739,"Came here for this- I was in genuine tears when he talked about his accident only to be swept up into hysterics when he told Conan if they were about to die in a coal mine, he was gonna bang him before they went out."
11740,The second one with Paul Rudd is great too. They go knee-high deep into *the shit*
11741,"Conan's *""nnnnngh yeeeeeah""* kills me every time"
11742,When was the last time you wore a tux?
11743,One and the same!
11744,Don't forget Paul Rudd who trolled Conan once more but on a Podcast where none of us could see the clip
11745,The Bill Hader and Bill Burr episodes are absolutely fantastic. I have tears in my eyes from laughing so hard at those ones haha
11746,I see you've gotten some work done! My advice? 10 percent more and *then* stop
11747,The Kevin Nealon episodes are like ADHD in a bottle. Everything starts but nothing ends.
11748,I'll add the John Mulaney ones are my favorites.
11749,I just caught the episode of Nealon's show yesterday with Conan. Definitely hilarious as well especially after hearing them talk about it on CONaF.
11750,"See if there's a way to reach out!  He seems like a compassionate, grounded guy, if your message reached him, I'd bet he'd appreciate it :)"
11751,Having this show during lockdown was a Godsend.
11752,"You absolutely need to. It was a little rough around the edges when it first started, but it has settled into this magnificent rhythm. It's truly special."
11753,WOODY GET DOWN
11754,He's my favorite comedian and I don't feel that it's bad to admit that you need to be at a certain level of energy to fully enjoy his humor and not become overwhelmed.
11755,"I love him but this podcast in particular can be too much. He and Sona fake laugh so much, and oftentimes he'll drag out a goofy sidetrack for way too long"
11756,"I know what you mean! He's so hilarious and generally a great interviewer, but sometimes it gets overwhelming how he derails anything anyone says into a joke/bit. I remember really feeling that way in the Weird Al episode - I love Weird Al and wanted him to ask Al good questions and get some interesting stuff out of him but the whole thing ended up being kind of a sillyfest and I got frustrated with it. 

However I just listened to the Billy Eilish and Finneas ep and felt the opposite, loved that one."
11757,r/conanbeingawesome
11758,"No, that's Jimmy Vivino, a member of his band on TV, and band leader on TBS :)"
11759,"I stopped listening when I heard him say ""Latinx"" unironically"
11760,"""25 out of 30 is not bad!""

That was just the icing on the cake of that whole 20 minute romp."
11761,I skip the interviews if I don't like the guests but I NEVER skip the intros and outtros.
11762,"Dunno who came first, but I've been listening to The Juice with Solomon Georgio, it's the same premise. I'll check this one out for sure! Any recs on which to start with?"
11763,Would you happen to know what episode this is? I'd really love to listen to it but can't seem to find it!
11764,I love all of these episodes but that one is my all-time favorite!!! I howled the final reveal
11765,"The bird lamp! This episode lives in my head, I can't shake it."
11766,"Same!  It's am absolute favorite history podcast, it's super immersing, the voice is phenomenal and the storytelling is superb.  I always prefer to watch his YouTube videos too, they're absolutely well done."
11767,"I've searched Cautionary Tales on my podcast app and 4 different ones have come up:

Cautionary Tales with Tim Hartford

Cautionary Tales with Jason Pettigrew 

Cautionary Tales (Tim Ebl & Ryan Hanson)

Cautionary Tales with Harper


Which one is it?"
11768,That's it!
11769,"This episode in particular shatters a lot of the racist myths about the decimation of the Rapa Nui people, it dispelled the things I had always assumed to be true about Easter Island that were just racist Western colonialist lies, it was really incredible."
11770,"Great show, well written and insightful."
11771,Yeah that was a good stroke of luck after all the BS. I really hope his daughter turns out to be legit and not shady. The guy wants family and for fuggs sake I hope he gets it.
11772,"I actually love the rambling they do, they have great chemistry together. Makes it feel like we're just listening to a casual discussion of a complex topic."
11773,"How prescient that mini-series was, specifically, episode 6 about man-made viruses leaking out of labs that supposedly have the highest lab security in the world. It also came out in 2018, so well before the pandemic. Granted, the lab leak is just a hypothesis, but this show definitely laid out how easily it could happen. All the other episodes are very interesting as well. I think I've listened to that full mini series 3 times now; so good!"
11774,"Well that one is scripted, so definitely less rambly. Love SYSK and End of the World, though, definitely recommend both"
11775,Did you listen to Josh's graduation speech a few years back? It was sort good
11776,I really enjoyed this one
11777,I LOVE this one
11778,"I long since rolled off SYSK, but I still think about and occasionally re-listen to The End of the World. It's so good."
11779,Came here to say this.  It was very insightful and aired at a time where it was very easy to visualize the hypothetical events he was discussing.
11780,An all time favorite. Better than SYSK even though it's so good in itself l.
11781,I'll check it out. He's the one whose perspective I relate to more on SYSK
11782,Chuck is the liability on sysk tbh so not surprised josh produced a high quality piece of work by himself
11783,"I give them a fair bit of leeway and more just think of it as interesting topics to think more about, with the podcast being a chill chat that highlights some of the topic."
11784,"I'm Muslim and I was honestly surprised about how well they covered their episode on Islam. They made some minor mistakes but it was overall much better than most.

The only episode I wasn't a fan of was their one on fluoride. They fell too hard on the conspiratorial side of it and anyone listening to it would've been convinced that it's a poison pushed on to us by greedy corporations where the benefits don't outweigh the cons, which is absurdly untrue."
11785,This is a common criticism of their podcast. In fact a lot of the podcast mentioned in this thread wont make pass r/Podcasts  scrutiny
11786,It's infotainment. I listen more for the vibe of chilling with Josh and Chuck than for serious learning.
11787,"The thing is, unlike other podcasts, they are very upfront about the fact they are giving a broad overview, and about their shortcomings and biases. 

I've listened to a couple episodes about topics I know as well, and while it can be frustrating, I think they are fair and earnest."
11788,"I got into them when a friend said. ""Hey you surf, you should listen to this."" It gave me some perspective and made me realize that the more you are into something, the harder it is to explain it all to a stranger in a brief amount of time.

Thought they did a really good job with it and it was my go-to podcast for a long time."
11789,"This was my same realization, then you go listen to The Omnibus podcast with Ken Jennings and you realize how much more researched that podcast is"
11790,"I used to listen to these guys all the time and it was like the Wikipedia version of topics but still enjoyable.  


I do remember years ago when they were in the same network as Stuff You Missed in History Class and called out fans about harassing and generally being nasty to the hosts of SYMHC.  And they were right!  People were way more likely to get on the hosts of that podcast about everything from research to the way their voices sounded to the topics being chosen.  The boys included some of the nastier bits of fan mail and Hollys pie chart of annual podcasts topics that proved ""every single podcast wasn't about women in history"".  


I just always found it ironic that people were OK with Josh and Chuck barely skimming a topic but ready to scream ""no you're wrong"" at the ladies who were getting real research and doing deep dives into shit I'd never even heard of."
11791,Yeah their MGM episode was baaaad
11792,100%. They read the wiki and a single article then make that a podcast. Once I realized that I had to stop listening
11793,It isn't meant to be all informative. It's infotainment lol
11794,It's a problem that I have with a lot of media lately. When someone is so wrong about topics I know about how can I trust what they say on topics I don't.
11795,"Yeah, I tried to get into it. But if I learn more from just reading the Wikipedia article than listening to their podcast the is just worthless."
11796,"Exactly. I discovered them kind of late a few years ago and would listen to quite a lot of their earliest episodes as I thought I would gradually catch up by listening to the most interesting sounding ones. When I tried more recent episodes, I just couldn't believe how many meaningful errors I could notice them blindly feeding people when I knew *anything* about the topic.

I just can't trust them as a source of information and they couldn't possibly be entertaining enough to overcome that fact when that educational information is the core of their podcast."
11797,This. They covered a topic I know very very well and by the end I was screaming because it was not only superficial but it was wrong and perpetuated misunderstanding. I stopped listening nor long after that.
11798,exactly my experience. They just skim Wikipedia and talk out of their ass
11799,"Yup, the same thing happened to my wife. I forget exactly what it was but they covered something music-related and she's like ""Whoa...is every episode like this?"""
11800,"Yeah, SYSK was in my rotation when I was first getting into podcasts but I quickly realized two things I didn't like about it:

1. Audio production wasn't my favorite
2. It's clear in some episodes that somebody just skimmed a Wikipedia page or a Cracked listicle and called it good where research was concerned.

Like...guys you can tell us information without sounding like you haven't had your coffee yet. Bonus points if you actually know and understand what you're talking about and aren't just reading a random article you found while googling shit. Smh"
11801,This was my issue as well. When they did a topic I was knowledgeable about I was shocked at their inaccuracies and errors. It was really disappointing because I liked their show.
11802,Same here. They'll regularly share false information just if it makes for a fun conversation. It started to annoy me.
11803,"Agree 100%.

The recent episodes make it obvious they Google things 5 minutes before they record. I enjoy podcasts where they cite peer reviewed research. SYSK isn't one of them."
11804,"I agree. I still like their chemistry. And some topics that I don't know at all are interesting to get a cursory info drop. 

But I agree that it's rough when it's a topic you are an expert in."
11805,Figured this out when I went looking for more info on something they mentioned in one of their episodes a while back. I couldn't find any sources on their site or anywhere else after several google searches :(
11806,"Same here; it's also kinda frustrating the sheer amount of tangents they go on. Don't get me wrong, I like a few sidebar conversations during a podcast, but they had *way* too many."
11807,"Right, but the episodes are meant to be a short introduction to topics people often know nothing about. Of course they aren't going to cover everything."
11808,"Yes, but I looked at those podcasts from the perspective of a layperson. While they didn't get every bit of a topic right, the general overview wasn't horrible. And really how detailed can you get in a one hour podcast?"
11809,"They have some good ones and some bad ones. I've been listening from the start so I probably have a bias but I would like to make a few points:

They never claim to be experts on any of the topics they cover, they've said many times over the course of the show that they are merely trying to give an unbiased surface level view of a lot of the stuff they talk about

While they do their own research, the bulk of the content of their articles comes from sourced writers. Not that this is an excuse to not do proper research, but I think as of late they rely a lot on the article writers themselves. 

They've done over 1,700 episodes... they're bound to get some stuff wrong or skimp out on some episodes

BUT LASTLY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY they are very accountable and will 100% own up to their mistakes and make on air corrections of incorrect things or misinformation they've said in their past. Something I feel a lot of people don't do anymore these days"
11810,"I was really excited when I saw juggling as a topic. I was really disappointed when I listened to that episode.

That said, if it's something I know little about, they're usually a good jumping off point."
11811,exactly why I stopped listening. and then there was a time where every episode had to spend too much time correcting the misinformation from their previous episode.
11812,"Agreed. I now use them as a primer, if I want to know more or if I want an unbiased opinion I can do my own research."
11813,"I listened to it once on an episode about cold therapy and impact on inflammation, they ended up making logical jumps to eventually settle on ""inflammation is actually a good thing because it's your body healing itself.""

Never listened to it again."
11814,"Two really chill, laid back guys choose a topic that they would both like to know more about.  They then spend a week (?) independently researching the topic.  Then on the show, they talk about they learned, what surprised them, and things they found especially funny, shocking, or thought provoking.

My favorite episodes were the one about the ""WOW! signal"" and the one about LSD."
11815,"Literally everything haha

The most recent one was about Skydiving, then playing cards, then the late bronze age collapse, cremations, they've got a recent one about woodstock, flamingos, crosswords....

They cover a bunch of random material and make many mundane things very interesting. Also family friendly! No swearing or vulgar humour"
11816,stuff you should know
11817,It's basically two dudes reading Wikipedia to you
11818,We love Josh and Chuck! It is always so comforting to listen to their banter and the wide range of topics offers something for everyone.
11819,You mean Josh and Charles W. Chuck Bryant?
11820,Especially a long drive with nothing to think about
11821,I like it for bite-sized chunks of listening. They have enough episodes to find something interesting (and then some).
11822,Samesies.
11823,My go to for longer drives too!
11824,They had a TV show for a while.
11825,Things You Don't Need to Know
11826,Not with that spelling anyway.
11827,It's Jeri. They recently talked about that one in their Crazy Fan Theories episode.
11828,It doesn't matter. I've listened since literally the beginning. Just start listening and if you're into it you can think about listening to the whole catalog. I've listened to those guys for so long I feel like they're personal friends. Sometimes I stop listening for awhile so I can build up a queue of episodes to binge.
11829,"Listen to an episode about a topic you know something about, so you can see if you can accept their level of shallowness. It's not a very well researched podcast."
11830,I can't say it's my favorite with how many thousands of episodes they have but owls is a good one
11831,"In my opinion, The Disappearance of the Yuba County Five is their best episode. Though I agree with everyone else that you can start listening from any point!

https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-stuff-you-should-know-26940277/episode/the-disappearance-of-the-yuba-county-29574148/"
11832,They both have very pleasant voices.
11833,Happy cake day!
11834,HAPPY CAKE DAY
11835,until their various ear-splitting jingles come on
11836,I actually much prefer this one.
11837,Interesting. My fiance used to listen to ologies and I could never get into it. I think maybe I just didn't like the host
11838,It's  almost just 2 random dudes reading a Wikipedia page to you. I listen sometimes but it's not am amazing source of information
11839,I find they go off topic a little too often.
11840,"my wife hates it because of the offtopic rambling, but i love it"
11841,Way more back room deals and scandals than i would've thought. I may need to buy myself some riding clothes and change careers.
11842,"Listened to the pod, and now work in the business world. Its the best business manual out there."
11843,And female anatomy.
11844,"This is the best line. I think it was ""three inch rivets"". Jamie pointing out how the Titanic is a horrific tragedy and obviously not sexy is hilarious. ""Not sexy Dad"""
11845,"The three inch rivets, if memory serves!"
11846,"My husband and I still quote this, so damn hilarious"
11847,Not a thing!
11848,"The one that really got me was Book One's use of the descriptor ""vagina lids""."
11849,"My wife was listening to it nearby and I wasn't really paying attention. I paused my game to take a sip of my drink and in that moment my ears focused on that beautifully poignant statement. I don't think I have *ever* gone so quickly from sedentary relaxation to gasping for my inhaler because I have laughed all of the oxygen out of my body. 

Rocky Flintstone is a legend"
11850,Right past the lids?
11851,"I have been listening to this with my husband for about a month now and every time a cervix is grabbed I just lose my shit lmao. I even brought up a diagram and explained to my husband where the cervix is and why you can't grab someone by their cervix. Sometimes I laugh so hard I almost puke, it's a fantastic podcast!"
11852,I used to listen to this at the gym and had to stop when I almost dropped some weight on myself because I was laughing so hard. Specifically the reference to the THREE INCH RIVETS THAT HELD TOGETHER THE HULL OF THE FATEFUL TITANIC.
11853,"Yes but did you throw yourself on to the road in distress with one boob out like our heroine, Belinda?"
11854,"I cannot listen to this while driving anymore -- or running, it's too difficult to laugh while running"
11855,I had to pull over for the breakdown over Ian Snail... It still gets me every time I hear it
11856,I took an extra long break at a stop sign in the middle of nowhere once because of the description of some Bleu cheese food. I was getting more than a little nauseated.
11857,I can't actually remember laughing harder at anything at all....
11858,IT PRONOUNCED THE L!
11859,"I feel the same, but I still enjoyed the podcast. For me, my enjoyment of it switched from laughing at the actual content of the books to laughing at the dynamics between Jamie, James and Alice and their banter.

I agree that books kind of became over the top and Rocky was clearly writing for the podcast. Felt forced."
11860,"This is baseless as hell. They specifically mentioned that Rocky had finished book 5 by epsiode 3 of the podcast. The podcast barely had it's own legs yet by week three so the influence we as the audience had on his writing was minimal at best.

He's just a mad man that wanted to right a spy story and went with it."
11861,"Yes, I completely agree!"
11862,TAC-y
11863,"Visceral reactions to every single line. I can only listen to it in the car, where I am free to cackle and yell in disgust."
11864,am Petra
11865,I laughed for an hour when Jamie did that. just keep rewinding and listening over and over.
11866,CARL!
11867,"Definitely from the beginning, there is a lot of lore and world building"
11868,You do not want to miss a second.
11869,The first few seasons are the best.
11870,"> We are now introducing it to our older children

The fuck? How does that conversation go?"
11871,"Hank Skank? Ian Snail? Butch, the sunburnt kid?"
11872,Toffee apple chew?
11873,What! I didn't know that. Hilarious.
11874,There's this dad and he wrote a porno
11875,"right? they say the name of the podcast, everyone talks about how hilarious it is, people quoting it, but not a single person has said what its actually about. sounds like it may be a reaction podcast to bad romance novels?"
11876,">But please, no packages, we will not open them. We do not trust you. (Dum Doo Doo dum dum)"
11877,"Lol, just left the same comment basically."
11878,The Lawsuit is my favorite probably because for the last 30 years I was so wrong about the facts. I was a toddler when the trial took place so I didn't do my own research. I assumed the plaintiff was driving with the coffee cup between her thighs causing it to spill and was looking for a payout. Like I genuinely feel guilty for my ignorance.
11879,"Yes, I absolutely love it! I hate the multi-host, banter-y podcast style that's so popular nowadays. ACC's style is such a breath of fresh air, and it fits so well with the subject matter. And omg yes, the Horse Queen episode was so wild! It would be totally unbelievable if I didn't know how well-researched the show was."
11880,I love Scamfluencers so much!
11881,Yeah statistically there's no way a person could play for that long and never pull the winning number.
11882,"I never thought a podcast about a bus station in Tel Aviv could be one of the most interesting things I've ever listened to, but here we are."
11883,"One thing I'll say about 99% Invisible: I've been listening for years, and it's always been one of my absolute favourite podcasts, but I've struggled with it a bit recently.

It used to feel like 90% of the episodes were rooted in the topical focus of design -- literally revealing to the listener the invisible things around us which make the world work the way it does -- with the occasional episode covering a story that, while certainly very interesting, doesn't quite scratch the same enlightening itch. 

Of course, every piece of media with a periodic format will have the sporadic dash of filler, but I've felt recently -- roughly since they released their book, in fact -- that the mix of design-focused vs. broader human intrigue is slipping more towards 50/50. 

Glancing at 2023's episodes so far, for example, there have been 15 instalments. Arguably, only half of them have that 'see the world differently' sense of wonder the podcast has always been celebrated for -- the episodes about cycling infrastructure in Amsterdam, the prison panopticon, the wilderness crosscut, the Polish anti-communist iconography, Brazil's soccer jersey, and the Twenty Thousand Hertz collab. Even if I were being liberal and added a couple more to this list, it'd only be half. 

*However*, this doesn't stop it from being one of the best podcasts of all time. While I don't find myself listening as consistently as I used to, when the 'design' episodes to pop up, they're absolutely glorious. And if you scroll back a year or two, you'll find a much higher ratio of golden episodes. It's a real treasure trove. 

I find podcast apps do a terrible job of introducing people to long-established series. With over 500 episodes of 99% Invisible, it could be hard to know where to start. I might honestly recommend just going back to the beginning. Starting from the very first episode. It's *that* good."
11884," [my favorite one was about the guy who placed a little Buddha statue in a median in an attempt to get people to stop dumping trash there, and it turned into an impromptu shrine.](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/hes-still-neutral/)"
11885,"If you like 99% Invisible, you might like Twenty Thousand Hertz. It specifically covers Sound Design. It's got the same educational tone that 99% has, also with a host with a cool name (Dallas Taylor) and smooth voice.

I feel like they're almost sister shows."
11886,"Me too, but I am going to say it's less random than the person you are replying to is implying. It's about how design, the kind that we often do not notice (like it's invisible!) shapes people's lives."
11887,The Wild Ones Live episode was one of the most beautiful pieces of media I've ever heard.
11888,"If you guys like 99pi, listen to Radio Lab!"
11889,"every single 99% invisible episode seems like a waste of time when you ONLY read the title, but then you listen to it and its one of the most interesting stories ever. In other words, I never know what i'm going to get"
11890,"Happy cake day, beautiful nerd (as Roman Mars would say)"
11891,Me too. I'm impressed it isn't higher on the thread
11892,Happy cake day!
11893,Happy cake day
11894,cake
11895,A comedy podcast about death!
11896,"OH MY GOD, IT'S BURNING!"
11897,Is that the same John Green who does the Crash Course History videos on YouTube?
11898,"Only a few short years away from that being a reality, thanks to the tireless efforts of Leon Muss"
11899,"he's in another podcast SciShow Tangents where he and two other lovely cohosts discuss science trivia on a certain topic. they have great chemistry! 

also Delete This! with his wife. it's not posted regularly anymore, but they discuss his twitter in a critical way. his wife is such a great foil for him- very grounded and very funny. great pod to binge"
11900,"I love John, but something about Hank just grates me and I can't watch him at all."
11901,"Damn, I forgot to add TAR to the list. Completely in agreement. Brilliant podcast."
11902,"I second this recommendation. Only a few episodes have fallen flat, the rest are fantastic."
11903,Thanks! Will check it out.
11904,Awesome! Thanks for the shout! Adding it to my Spotify list.
11905,"You know what, you're right. Never thought of it from that perspective before, but compeletely agree."
11906,Thanks for the rec!
11907,"McElroys! Didn't realize they had a podcast. Thanks! I knew them as guests/players for Dimension 20's *Tiny Heist* (Dropout.tv, DMed by Brennan Lee Mulligan). I believe they have the full first episode on YT."
11908,Thank you for the recommendation! I'm definitely going to check it out.
11909,"Hey, will def check it out! Thanks!"
11910,Thanks! Will check them out.
11911,Haha... thanks!
11912,PASS
11913,I think Louis Theroux has my second favourite episode after Joe Thomas.
11914,"If you like ^^look ^^out, ^^it's ^^only Films to be Buried With, check out Off the Beat and Track by Stu Wiffen. It's basically the same concept but with music. It's a great listen."
11915,"He just seems like such a good person. A lot of celeb podcasts I find feel more like the host is only really interested in being interesting / funny themselves, and don't actually listen to the guest much - you can tell Brett really engages with the guest and seems to enjoy talking to them."
11916,"All of the podcasts on the distraction pieces network are worth thr listen. 

Scroobius pip has years worth of fantastic conversations."
11917,100%. I found Off Menu with their Red Nose Day crossover how many ever years ago and so glad I did. It's my favorite now with Films and Taskmaster podcast in rotation.
11918,I hope he helped them with their project.
11919,"I laughed out loud during last week's episode with John Kearns though. It really depends on the guest, I guess."
11920,"They get bigger guests now (a lot more ""national trezh"" guests), who often are there as part of a press tour and aren't necessarily familiar with the podcast, and those often aren't as funny.  But there's still been plenty of great ones--I actually really enjoyed the Florence Pugh and Paul Mescal ones recently even if they weren't as laugh out loud as some of the ones with their comedian friends.  Also the Paul Chowdhry and Richard Ayoade eps last year were both incredible."
11921,Still or sparkling?
11922,Shows like this I find you just have to skip any you aren't interested in. Not every week will be someone you care about listening to. You'll miss some surprise good episodes but it's worth it to not get burnt out.
11923,you're missing out
11924,"This is the only one of theirs I haven't listened to lol (unless they have more, i'm a bit behind)

My Brother My Brother and Me is amazing

And the Adventure zone is what got me into podcasts.

Just don't listen to podcasts like Sawbones or i'm sure I would think it's amazing too"
11925,Listen to a out any of the podcasts from that company.
11926,"> McElroy

Soy as fuck"
11927,"As much as I enjoyed it, when almost every episode was about covid I trailed off on it. I know they tried to intersperse other topics but it was just a lot when we were in the thick of it to listen to 3 episodes back to back all about covid, after coming home from working in a hospital and everything being about covid. I did eventually listen to a lot of them."
11928,America Dissected and the House of Pod are also good medical-adjacent podcasts. Both focus mainly on current events and issues in the US healthcare system.
11929,"That, and when I burn myself I think, ""where's a magnet when I need one?"""
11930,"Justin also does a podcast with his 2 brothers called My Brother My Brother And Me. The 3 boys do a role-play podcast with their dad called The Adventure Zone. Sydnee did another podcast as well, but I don't recall the name as I hadn't listened yet.

Eta minor grammar fixes."
11931,Season 1 of TAZ legitimately made my cry several times. The ending is just beautiful.
11932,"I stopped listening to TAZ after Amnesty. The first campaign was extremely fun, Amnesty was great, and then the others just didn't make me feel the way the others did. Maybe it's just cause Griffin is a more experienced GM, and I got more used to him, but during Graduation I noticed I was just forcing myself to listen.

It still holds a dear place in my heart, but I don't think I will be going back to it. Sawbones is the only McElroy podcast I still listen to."
11933,I think I'm one of the few people who just really hates riffing in a podcast if it doesn't add anything. Every time I've heard Sawbones I just really want Justin to stop interrupting.
11934,Sawbones and Schmanners are two of the worst podcasts on the app. Used to really love the Mcelroys but they've been coasting off past success for awhile now
11935,"It was a joke, but whatever."
11936,"Man I was thinking exactly the same thing recently with the ones about Napoleon's invasion and the Winter War. 

It's just deja vu over and over and over again. 

There was one particular battle that blew my mind, where the Finnish-Soviet casualty ratio was 400:17,000. To the point that the Finnish command kinda didn't believe their own men weren't inflating the numbers.

Or the 25 year serfdom conscription (in the 1800s!) in imperial Russia where these men's lives revolved only around the military, and as such had plenty of resigned meat to feed the grinder."
11937,"When he has his producer Nate on it's really good. Nate was a US Army officer, very good humoured and knowledgeable and recently diagnosed with adhd which causes him to go off on these hilarious tangents sometimes."
11938,The most recent handful of episodes have been stellar. Their series on the Troubles in particular was excellent balancing of dark humor and sobering storytelling.
11939,"The hardest thing about getting into a podcast that's been around for a bit is finding a good entry point.   Most podcasts take a while to hit their stride and so listening to the very first one is not indicative of the overall quality and this one is no exception in that regard.

One of my personal favorites is about U-Boats and how awful it was for the crews manning those ships.  I suggest you give that one a try and if you enjoy it great, if not then you know it's probably not going to be something you are going to enjoy the rest of."
11940,"As long as the guest host isn't Alice Caldwell Kelly it's not too bad. Any episode she's on gets uncomfortable fast, she's just so mean-spirited. And not towards the genocidal maniacs the show covers, she's forever trying to both-sides things in a weird way. If you avoid the shows she cohosts it's gotten better than it was a few years ago."
11941,"I love Liam, but it's good that he isn't the permanent sole co-host. 

What I do feel bad about, though, is I kinda hope Nick never returns. He seems like a nice guy I just don't enjoy listening to him."
11942,"I like Liam in WTYP, where he's one part of a larger cast. He can bounce off the walls there so to speak. But in a one on one setting, he can be a bit much. Love the guy... but in moderation."
11943,"I've got to agree. I honestly can't deal with the stupid interruptions that add nothing, or some boring tangent on something he wants to hate on The War of the Triple Alliance series would be my top favorite series, but Liam ruins it for me). I miss Nick and Rich of course, but Nate and Tom are the best co-hosts he has had by far. They have great chemistry and they are both very interesting and knowledgeable"
11944,I have a film degree and have been watching movies obsessively my entire life and I am regularly blown away by their film knowledge.
11945,"I'd say start with the recent Kubrick eisodes
  
I stopped listening for a couple of years because Griffin's constant interruptions and verbal tics made me hate hearing his voice
  
There were a few months where every one of his sentences ended in ""riiigghhhtttt?"" And he'd stop someone mid-sentence to talk about the time he saw Cookie Sobotka two blocks from the deli you just mentioned after he saw Toy Story 2 on 16mm the second time in that hat. You remember that hat? The ribbon looked exactly like film, but it matched Bo Peep's Dress fabric. It was funny, you know what I mean? Her hat. And I know you were talking, and I'll get back to that, but I just have to mention that TS2 has unsurpassed Bo Peep audio directing for the franchise. Riiiiight? It's just so emotive while being raw. You know what I mean? *Yeah, that's totally true Griffin. Anyway, Mr. Spielberg's phone connection seems to have dropped, so we'll just do the Box Office game instead of the Q&A we mentioned on Twitter*"
11946,I also love the Boston episode where they review 99 with Dano. The bit about the transforming booth being the only good thing there kills me.
11947,BOWL!
11948,Also the craziest blank check march madness yet
11949,"I'm generally pretty good about reining in my parasocial relationships but Nick and Mitch are my blind spot - I'm just so invested in those lovable weirdos!

Also if you love Doughboys check out the Sloppy Boys podcast too, similar energy and occasional Mitch tales from their Birthday Boys days."
11950,Wow
11951,That bit is over!
11952,W H A T
11953,"I've been listening to ologies for a few years now, and it's one of the best podcasts imo for any scientifically inclined individual. I also like how she interviews not just ""the best of the best"" for each field but usually some mostly normal scientist within a certain ology. Such as the rocks episode or trees episode, where it's just a couple of friendly chill rock and tree enthusiasts. It's also fairly accessible for all audiences and doesn't go too deep or specific in any one field such that it can't be understood if you know nothing about it to begin. I think it's an excellent example of how science communication should be done."
11954,And a lot of episodes have excellent transcripts available!
11955,Such a good show!
11956,"I found D&Daddies via another Podcast that featured it, Imaginary Worlds. I tried a few other D&D podcasts and none of them were anywhere as fun to listen to as D&Daddies.

Also via Imaginary Worlds I learned of a now wrapped up podcast - Mission to Zyxx."
11957,"Check out Dragon Friends! Aussie comedy dnd, it's hilarious."
11958,"Girls who don't dnd, you're welcome :)"
11959,"There's an upcoming project in the same universe, but it apparently won't feature the same characters."
11960,What's it about ?
11961,I recommend you Old Gods of Appalachia if you need to scratch that horror anthology itch.
11962,There is a lot of content there! Start from the beginning?
11963,"It was great until the last few episodes.. It dragged everything on, plus that whole romance plot came out of NOWHERE and went to 100 fast."
11964,Doodlers Unite!
11965,"The first season was fantastic.  I had a really hard time going through the second season, and fell off a couple dozen episodes in or so.  Honestly, it was probably because I binged the first season such that I caught up within a month of the finale, and I don't like waiting a week between episodes."
11966,"The daddies and Naddpod have kept me sane these past few years, that's for sure. The patreons are so beyond worth it as well!"
11967,Just got my D.A.D.D.I.E.S. mug from the patreon!
11968,What platform?
11969,Listening to it while reading this!
11970,"Lost Jons Cave, I assume?"
11971,"That last season especially was kinda brutal at the start with how eerily it coincided with the pandemic, especially the Sick Village episode."
11972,"A lot of people just don't realize audio dramas exist (/had a resurgence) and consider podcasts synonymous with news, talk shows and education. Which are all great, but yes, people are definitely missing out."
11973,"NADDPOD/DnDaddies are some of the best and most accessible DnD podcasts around. Length and ""low"" player count help them both out so much in reaching new fans."
11974,I like Sneak Attack! too.
11975,Heavyweight makes me feel a specific mix of emotions that I don't get from other media. It's so genuine and funny while still able to be heartbreaking and touching. I always look forward to new seasons!
11976,Scrolled too long for Ologies
11977,"Heavyweight lost me when they went Spotify-exclusive. 

I hate Spotify and am not willing to switch just because they bought out Gimlet."
11978,"The problem I had with this one is that seemingly a third of the stories are about people's inability to communicate effectively. Had to unsubscribe after getting yet another episode about ""I regret not telling <person> about <emotion> regarding <event> given <circumstance>."""
11979,I fucking hated podcasts until I found Ologies! I love that there's no mindless irrelevant chit chat.
11980,That being the first ever roll of the entire show sets the tone so well lmao
11981,Agree!!!
11982,Mightn't I the Gristle?
11983,QUEEN SHIT OF LIES-VILLE
11984,Action park
11985,I'm the fucking hippo guy!
11986,No sleep till hippo
11987,which episode should I listen to to get this?
11988,"Behoooold, Zombo!"
11989,"To me that makes me a bit sad. I feel like there is a reason that's been the intro for so long; that was sorta the peak for me. 

Dave just seems so irritating now that I can't listen to newer stuff anymore after it being one of the first things that made me love podcasts.

I think it started he started to really lean into his intros and political views. 

The bad part is I don't disagree with the guy it's just that I'm just here to listen about 10c beer night and not your opinions; I'm here to avoid that stuff.

Edit: Not sure why I'm getting downvoted....I agree with Dave politically, I enjoy the stories. I'd just wish they were separate. I'd sub if he made a political rant podcast but I also just like having ""goofy/interesting stories"" podcasts."
11990,Is eet for fun?
11991,*The Magic Man*
11992,Stop saying J-Town it will never catch on!
11993,"Rube is one of the best, but I feel like everyone sleeps on the Truck Nuts episode. Who knew that you could get over 60 minutes worth of conversation about plastic testicles to put on your vehicle, but the story is legit interesting and is some of the funniest Gareth improv."
11994,"I am not a fan of modern baseball, but the Rube episode made me want to travel back in time to watch him... well, not *play*, so much as bail on a game to chase a fire truck or go fishing."
11995,"They discuss that in their patreon episodes sometimes. Basically they say you have to learn to accept these are interesting times we're living in and you have to find the joy in seeing a collapse in first person and real time.

It sucks to live through history."
11996,There's a freakin musical of all things about Floyd Collins (and it's actually really good)
11997,I love how the live shows are always about wherever they are.  Happy crowds.
11998,The penguin island episode might be one of the most hilarious podcast episodes ever recorded.
11999,"The Hamilton episode was eye opening. The Broadway show, and American history,  have painted that fellow in a spectacularly bad light."
12000,Wells Fargo episode was legitimately one of the things that turned me from a moderately apathetic Republican to an incredibly politically active Elizabeth Warren supporter.
12001,">	to his nemesis Gareth Reynolds

FTFY :)"
12002,Let's not forget about nercopants.....
12003,"The man who rode the lightning, the Rube, and $.10 beer night are must listens."
12004,Join the Garmy!
12005,Gareth. Not Gary.
12006,Needs two more facts about Dave.
12007,I don't think he needs to have the 'about' at the end there.
12008,I almost laughed at this and would have had to explain it to my coworker who I'm sure has never listened to a podcast in her life
12009,It's GARETH. We've been over this.
12010,"This was actually my gateway into The Dollop (I'm a newcomer!).

I feel like just about every Dollop is hilarious, where Past Times is really dependent on how good the guest is at riffing. Some episodes are just Dave and Gary being funny and then guest being like ""wow that's weird"" a lot."
12011,WHEAT!
12012,"I was working at a Greek restaurant / bar in Austin when this episode came out. Was cleaning up and laughing so hard, my manager who didn't know that podcasts exist checked in with me to see why I was cackling while mopping the dining room"
12013,This was my gateway episode. Pair this with the Segal episodes and people should be hooked.
12014,"I'm not taking any more questions today, Mr. Peppers has a cold."
12015,"Based on your username, you should listen to F@*kface"
12016,SNACK CRACKLE POP ARE IN CAHOOTS?!?!?!
12017,"Possibly because it's kind of hit or miss and a lot of their best stuff is in the earliest episodes which are almost 10 years old now. There are some truly amazing episodes though. The Rube is the gold standard; Ten cent beer night, Otto in the Attic, Straw Hat Riot, The Jackson Cheese, The Dolphin. I mean those were all amazing stories. When they're on, they are really good, but when they're off it just isn't entertaining.

I stopped listening to them a few years back partly because they seem to have gotten a little too big on themselves. You'd catch comments where they just come off as really condescending to people who know anything about agriculture or rural life. I live in the Midwest and I'm painfully aware of both of those things.  Their coastal elitist views shine through on some of the things they say and it finally just got to be too much for me to ignore at some point and I stopped listening to them. They kept that all in check when they did a show in KC at least, so that was good. It's a good episode too, it's episode 319 The Missouri Mormon War. One of the last episodes of theirs I thoroughly enjoyed."
12018,"If you haven't heard the Steven Segal three-parter, do yourself a favour - absolute insanity."
12019,"Try listening to #12 the rube or #2 purity balls or #23 Willie dee. 
Those are some of the best episodes in my opinion. If you don't like those, you probably won't like the podcast / format.

Some of the later episodes have been very story focused and the majority has to do with politics, which are meant to highlight how some stuff has always been pretty bad. While I get where they are coming from and it's probably just their answer to the increasing political madness people hear every day, it can be difficult or boring to listen to, so Gareth tries hard to come up with funny things in a rather unfunny story."
12020,It's hit or miss. When Gary is funny it makes for a great episode. When he's not then it just feels like an obnoxious interruption to an interesting story.
12021,Lol it's not for you. You don't have the sense of humor to enjoy it.
12022,"Oh no, they're always excruciating. 
  
God forbid we get a sustained enjoyable narrative instead of four minute riff with New Funny Voice
  
Also, their levels are fucking rough. Do they know the can compress audio? It's not Miles Davis in studio, podcasts don't need pristine dynamics.
  
Twenty seconds of information, two minutes of riffing, and laughter that's twice as loud and long as the narration. That's The Dollop."
12023,"Wil Anderson is on probably the best Australia episode The Animal Horror of Macquarie Island. The next best ones are without him, German Pilot Hans Bertram and Battle of Brisbane."
12024,"Purity Balls. An uncomfortable subject for some, but I admit to crying laughing."
12025,Jackson Cheese and Mike Maloy are also really good early ones.
12026,Read the comments fine Reddit person.
12027,"I like the fact that he doesn't dance around that stuff. Is it rough to hear, absolutely."
12028,"He only does it in quotes and normally prefaces the worst ones with a disclaimer. You're being downvoted because most people believe that shouldn't be sugar coated in a historical context. Some vile things are said because people in history said some vile things. And, honestly, that helps give the measure of someone's character"
12029,Yurt
12030,"Same. I have loved The Rubberbandits for years but only started listening to his podcast a few weeks ago. 
Feels like I missed out on getting in on the ground floor, but im catching up now."
12031,I always thought of myself as a Brooding Una
12032,"The Moth might be my favorite of all.

The stories there are the stories of humanity. I've experienced literally every emotion listening to that podcast.

I think we would all be better if we shared our stories and understood the humanity behind everyone in the world."
12033,"Hello, I'm Ira glass. Thank you for being a sustaining member. Everyone has a story, and your phones story is that it's ringing"
12034,"Back when I first came to Reddit TAL was one of the most recommended podcasts, it was one of the first I ever listened to. Maybe there are just so many more now."
12035,"TAL, Radiolab, SGU, Freakinomics... So many solid mainstays that have been killing it forever are just getting no respect."
12036,"I think it suffers from popularity in this case.  Like if somebody asks about Fantasy books, nobody goes ""Ooh, have you read Lord of the Rings?""  Because simply by asking the question, there's some implication that they've either already read it, or they've deliberately chosen not to.  TAL is the ""Lord of the Rings"" of podcasts.

Radiolab is another good one, though I'm pretty bummed about both hosts leaving.  Not that the new ones are bad, but it's like how a new hoodie is never quite as comfortable as the one you've worn for years."
12037,I think the reason is because of the demographics for Reddit.  Most Redditors were born in the late 1990s and early 2000s and just don't have much of a cultural reference point.  It's my guess.
12038,TAL is the OG. They basically created podcasts.
12039,"I've never listened to a dud. Even when I read the theme and think, naw, this sounds uninteresting, it turns out to be amazing.

Fiasco! is my favorite, btw. Honorable mentions to:

- 129 Cars

- Pirates

- Superheroes 

- Switched at birth

- Christmas and Commerce"
12040,"I stopped listening to TAL when I heard the episode about the son that spoke English and the dad who only spoke Chinese.

When the son finally reads the translated letter I ball. hard. every time. 

I listen to podcasts at work so I can't be crying a river."
12041,"I find it shocking it's so low. I love TAL, it's so well researched and produced."
12042,"I've never considered it a podcast. I always saw it as a radio show that is also has a podcast platform.

This shit has been airing since before iPods."
12043,"To be fair, TAL has been established for decades. Kinda like recommending the Beatles"
12044,I listened for a while but they had too many repeats.
12045,"Absolutely agree TAL is too damn low on this thread. Genuinely shocked given how popular it was just a few years ago on one of these threads. 

The last episode #765 Off Course, with the story about the girl from China whose dad willed her into getting into the conservatory fucked me up. I was holding my newborn daughter listening to it and my wife walks in and im in a ball of tears and she was like wtf? I had to explain how I need to remember how important it is that being a parent means you're the person who has to AT ALL COSTS believe in your kids. Because if you don't no one else in the world will give them a chance. What a beautiful story."
12046,"Some of these shows are classics, but one might do better to dig into the back catalog. This American Life is amazing storytelling, but found their best stories years ago."
12047,My favorite contributor to that show is Torey Malatia.
12048,"I drifted away in the wake of the 2016 election, when it felt like the pod became more about making sense of the political landscape and less slice-of-life stuff in general. I don't come to TAL for that, so it just fell off my rotation."
12049,"It's still the best podcast out there, now that Radiolab's hosts have retired. But, podcasts now appeal to a broad range of interests compared to the heyday of TAL, and lot of the ones mentioned here in this thread seem to appeal to people who don't connect so well with podcasts that require empathy and robust mirror neurons."
12050,"The first TAL was mud 90's, it's a gem of a program and really the prototype of modern podcasting."
12051,"No, it's super popular and started the podcasting revolution in a sense."
12052,I think it's probably that it's so popular nobody felt the need to post it.
12053,"Tell me about it. 

At least I've seen it after a minute or two of scrolling 

Still haven't caught Radiolab or ScienceVS"
12054,Probably just not much overlap between a TAL/Moth listener and the average reddit user.
12055,"I dip in and out. They do a *lot* of reruns, so I tend to forget to check it sometimes"
12056,Love this American life!!!! Ira is the bessssst
12057,It's gotten shittier steadily imho. I loved its early years though
12058,Might be so low because many consider it a radio show first instead of a podcast.
12059,"That episode is my fave! Pure gold, i couldn't stop laughing."
12060,"There need to be more ""limited"" series podcasts on this list. Shit Town is incredible.  I wish I could listen to it for the first time again."
12061,One of the few podcasts that has really stuck with me. So well done.
12062,"They've done multiple live shows, including at least one & maybe more that were also simulcast into movie theaters. Very fun experiences"
12063,"I listen every Monday on Spotify, if you're still interested in listening..."
12064,"They always disclose reruns. ""This episode is a rerun of an episode we did in [date]"" is almost always after the intro and first commercial break, when giving an overview of the chapters of the episode. Many of them end with an update to where people are now in the end credits too."
12065,"If you get it via a Podcast app you can tell if it is a rerun by the show number.   

The most recent one was episode 795, which I think is the latest new release.  But last weeks was something like episode 765 and the week before that was episode 654.  Which I can tell are both reruns."
12066,I had to stop listening when they produced the vocal fry episode! I just couldn't take it anymore.
12067,"Go to their subreddit and search for ""rss"" and you'll find instructions for adding their archive to your podcast app. I just now did it after reading some of the episode recommendations in this thread and it was pretty easy."
12068,My personal favourite was Masso playing Klaw from black panther visiting kids hospitals with prosthetic limbs encouraging the kids to be evil.
12069,"Pervert Kenobi has me creasing up every time.

Can't recommend this podcast enough"
12070,"""I.... I don't know!"" 
-	Rey, 2023"
12071,What's the other one?
12072,/r/commentsyoucanhear
12073,"With me is Spafficus Brindlemart, emeritus professor of ancient basket weaving and antiquities at the London school of economics, and honorary chair of the grumbles at Gunsten college, Cambridge..."
12074,"Looooong back catalogue too if you get into it. It's been on Radio 4 in the UK since about the mid 90s.

Absolutely what the BBC was made for."
12075,"For me that is a huge part of what makes it so good. His ability to keep the experts on topic and focused is absolutely unrivaled.  Way better than ""science"" podcasts that consist of a couple of people constantly going off on tangents."
12076,"The thing is, he has several experts sat there who left to their own devices will ramble on and on and things would never get anywhere. He has to be firm with them"
12077,"Me too.  I love how cantankerous he is.  That's the best part.  Plus, after you listen for a few years you realize Melvin knows a lot!"
12078,Check out the Industrial Revolution episode if you can find it. (First one - I think it's multi-part). The first twenty minutes are basically a fist fight.
12079,[deleted]
12080,Me too! I loved the Dixie Chicks episode and that's so not my style!
12081,"""The problem with the Gallagher brothers can be summed up very easily; Noel has a lot of buttons, Liam has a lot of fingers"""
12082,"I never listen to podcasts more than once, and I listened to that Third Eye Blind one 3 times.  

""I don't even know how much he weighs."""
12083,"The whole Britpop saga is amazing with the petty rivalries between the bands. Loved the Pulp episode especially, gave me a reason to listen to their whole catalogue."
12084,"Also love this,  especially the ""Baby one more time"" episode. I actually used that one to get my wife hooked on the show and writing/delivery."
12085,That's me in the corner
12086,Alright hold my reddit fellow 90ers
12087,"He's alluded a couple times to ""the one song everyone knows has to be on the list"" or something like that, and how he's putting it off because it ""feels too big"" or words to that effect.   So I fully expect Smells Like Teen Spirit to be the final episode."
12088,"It's even funnier that Courtney Loved praised him as [""stentorian voiced dudely bro""](https://twitter.com/harvilla/status/1628882755722391554?t=wDBBEHjkt3DT06NuwcBggQ&s=19)"
12089,"Nirvana's not on there yet, but it's mentioned in like every other episode.  He'll get there, he has made it very clear that you can't talk about 90s music without discussing the time a punk band from Seattle upended the entire global music scene.  He'll get there"
12090,The episode about Hole was actually great though. It completely changed my perspective on that band and their music.
12091,I really *wanted* to love this one but I could not get into it. What a fascinating topic and the host somehow makes it the dullest podcast of all time.
12092,"It's very American-centric, but he references Europop influences a lot on the pop acts, like Backstreet Boys, for example, plus Max Martin's Europop influence producing major American artists. There's also an episode dedicated to Spice Girls."
12093,"Majority is American, some really good hip hop.

But there is are still a lot of Britpop and other UK/Euro pop songs if thats what you are looking for.

Well worth it."
12094,"Kinda? He'll play 20-30 secs of the song, usually to reference the lyrics. Then at the end, ""Now, go listen to [song of episode]"""
12095,He plays whatever amount you can play without having to pay royalties. He usually references or incorporates about 30 other songs per episode with little samples of each
12096,"eh i like Hold my Beer as a starter episode just so people can get a feel for the actual format, which is like discarded for that episode"
12097,"Maybe not, I'd wait till you've watched a few others to get to know the hosts better."
12098,"Getting harder to listen HARD, we're getting older ya know."
12099,One of us speaks in riddles one of us speaks in rhymes
12100,Thanks for asking
12101,But how is Bob's fridge?
12102,Thanks for asking
12103,What a good way to look at it. 3 buddies in a car with you
12104,"I mean it is pals bullshitting, but they'revery sitcom-esque. You don't have to listen to it if you're not just looking for some funny noise, but you really should listen to ""Bob's fridge"" and just treat it as a one off stand up comedy special even if you aren't interested in it otherwise."
12105,"It mostly is pals bullshitting, and they go off on wild tangents and touch really interesting subjects"
12106,"It's legitimately just that. Dudes laughing at each others stories, they are decent enough story tellers though and they have good timing with sound edits but they really seem to lean into the whole ""distractable"" bit, often going off the rails and stretching what could have been a 5 or 10 minute story into 45 minutes. But that's the point I guess. 

More or less listening to goofy stories from a couple of bros who posses the gift of the gab."
12107,"It absolutely is pals bullshitting, they just have truly incredible comedic chemistry and the perfect barely-there framework for it (one host picks a topic for the episode, the two other guys discuss/compete at that topic, whoever is decided the winner by the host becomes that guy next episode, the cycle continues). Like, this is the gold standard for pals bullshitting."
12108,Ironic
12109,Lol I was surprised that people claim this bc I listen to it while driving all the time
12110,"Also incredibly well produced! The music, editing, writing, pacing - all easily top tier of any show I've ever experienced. Feels super well polished compared to the kinda ad lib style of most podcasts"
12111,Same here! I was excited for this thread but... I dunno. Blowback is one of my favorites.
12112,Way too far down lol
12113,"I was super excited when I first learned they were doing a Korean war season. Most Americans have such an incredibly distorted view of the war due to the long term end result being the current North Korean state. With Vietnam or Iraq, a lot of Americans will acknowledge they were immoral or largely failed in their goals, but I find most consider intervention in Korea to be correct.

Most people I've spoken to about it have no idea that Korea was unified before the post-WW2 partition, or that the US had a brutal military dictatoship that resisted reunification, or the massacres like the one at Jeju island, or that we killed like 1/6 of the population, or how close we came to using nukes again. 

Very very eye opening season."
12114,"The first time I ever learned about what happened in Korea -- that was actually through Lovecraft Country, which only showed a very small sliver of that. I forget if they mentioned this in Blowback but this stuff wasn't taught about until just recently, and they still deny it happened. For more I recommend reading Ghost Flames and also The Jakarta Method."
12115,Less media coverage at the time that is still around that they can cut to and more accounts of the war that they have to reference from various sources. I get the same feeling too after being spoiled with so much first hand stuff (recordings and the like) from the first two seasons.
12116,"I'm re listening to them. They go over so much it's hard to take in.  If your into that one check out ""at the brink"".  Goes over nuclear safety and is only 10 episodes but it's so good."
12117,That and I felt they were more apologist to the North Koreans. Seemed to lack nuance which was also vaguely present in the Cuban season. I understand the hosts are leftists but they should reckon with both the fact of the evils of American imperialism as well as the imperfections of totalitarianism seen in Marxism-Leninism states which is hardly an innocent utopia
12118,Well why don't you cry about it?
12119,The episode where they realise Blake has been using the soundboard throughout but only he could hear it was one of the funniest things I ever listened to
12120,*Issa bagel*
12121,Lol I don't listen to the pod for weeks at a time and then I save them up for road trips. When did that start and is there some reference I'm missing? It's always Kyle saying it and you can hear him or Blake giggling about it but I don't get it (still makes me laugh though)
12122,That shit's important
12123,[deleted]
12124,"If you've ever watched Workaholics & thought ""how did these guys make up 3/4 dysfunctional semi-idiots who just smoke weed all day!?""

This podcast answers it. Turns out they genuinely are that dumb. especially Blake & Adam.

IE it's the guys from Workaholics just chatting. Mostly about how Adam needs to go dry for a week. At least."
12125,"It's all references/bits/soundbites from the podcast, which sort of actually does describe the podcast, because it's not really about anything *important* it's just the workaholics crew shooting the shit with eachother in an entertaining way."
12126,Hot celebrity goss. It's aaa disgusting habit.
12127,"We only talk about what's obviously, critically, crucially important. Today on this is important, ""ding dong door bell ditch"". I just started listening last month and have already burned through 70 episodes their camaraderie and humorous banter keep me interested"
12128,I'm pissed now!
12129,Its the essence of parasocial relationships
12130,Naked grandma!
12131,It was truly naked grandma of everyone to ignore TII nation
12132,Thank you God!
12133,DO NOT CUM
12134,Do you know what this is from? Its my favorite sound bit and I have no idea why
12135,"Well its been 6rs and I'm still listening to it... thanks reddit for my new pod!!! 

My thanks: podcast ""national park after dark"" Park true crime."
12136,"I don't necessarily hate workaholics but it's strange how naturally charming and funny the guys are in comparison to their written jokes

Somehow their natural conversation is leagues funnier than their professionally written humor"
12137,Well why dont you cry about it
12138,"They're still remixing old callers/bits/puzzlers and cranking out new episodes on a weekly basis.  I think I read that they have enough content for like a 7-10 year cycle.  Keep in mind to make a 1 hour weekly radio program, they did a 3 hour block of callers every week for like 30 years."
12139,Yes- dang how I miss that show!!! I still listen to the old shows a lot though.
12140,Erasmus B. Dragon
12141,"What a delightful memory.  I also listened to it as a kid in the car with my parents, I always loved the fake credits, like ""Chauffeur:  Picov Andropov."""
12142,I hate cars but I loved listening to that show growing up.
12143,"You're all excited about this, but what is it like?

I'm a European car guy"
12144,Bell's Palsy once came up in conversation and it took everything in my power not to mention Biv's Palsy and Devoe's Palsy.
12145,hot tub foot?
12146,I've almost ran off the road twice from laughing so hard while listening to CBB/Comedy Death Ray. Ducca's puff knuckle and listing to Dalton Wilcox's first appearance. Vampire! Vampires!! VAMPIRES!!
12147,"Rabies, Scabies, Mickey Rooney Sugar Babies"
12148,I recently learned the dukka is the Buddhist word for suffering and laughed for way too long
12149,"Eh, there are a few I like more. I'd elaborate, but I just found a bunch of hair in this pillow I got from bed, bath, and beyond and am leaving a review. And my gf Carissa is being a duplicitous bitch. Da fuq?!"
12150,Bob Duccas rendition of Wrecking Ball is by far the funniest thing I've ever heard. I cry-laugh about it still
12151,I have his shirt and he's constantly mistaken for Ron Swanson ):
12152,Victor Diamond's podcast had to be one of the funniest things I've ever heard
12153,"If you hadn't listened to it, look for episode 700 and then 704. In 700 Andy Daly has to switch up between 4 characters at the same time.700 talks about a plan and it hits the real world like days later and 704 talks about the aftermath."
12154,"Ugh, I don't need a new podcast, but Brendan Small doing improv is like hyper targeted catnip for me. Fuuuuuuck..."
12155,I miss him being on the show. Those are some of my favorite episodes.
12156,"Dethklok is touring this year you should go!  Last time i went to a Dethklok concert (2008, wow) Brendan Small had full conversations on stage with himself as the Nathan, Pickles, Skwisgaar--it was incredible."
12157,Scott Hackerman
12158,An absolutely deranged human being
12159,MKB 
12160,"Thank goodness. If you didn't share this, I would have had to."
12161,"I came to post this one too. Love it. 

""Got time to give me one? Oh ya Scott? No? Alright.""

It's right up there with [The Chief](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cUxsIW3auGk) trying to catch Carmen San Diego for me."
12162,Beep toot
12163,"Beautiful songs, thank you for sharing."
12164,It's not time for that yet
12165,You can find her twitter so easily
12166,I think you mean foam corner..
12167,He was the best.  Random phone corner jokes still pop into my head from time to time.
12168,"Weirdly, I still remember the moment I was listening to CBB when they said Harris died. It was at the end of a long drive at night I had been on."
12169,"I think about him every time someone uses the term ""humblebrag,"" which he coined."
12170,"God, the ""Farts and Pro"" episodes were the first I'd listened to, I knew Adam & Chelsea but not him, but immediately I loved Harris and he had me in stitches, binged the whole series and my heart fucking dropped getting to the final one and Scott opening with that awful news. Guy was so hilarious and had so much potential"
12171,it comes and goes so quickly. just like the age of my granddaughter. so grew up too quickly.
12172,Do they know its Wet Day?
12173,And to all a wet night!
12174,A happy wet day to all!
12175,Stay away from our granddaughter
12176,WAP is my favorite wet day carol
12177,Before I knew it I was dry again
12178,Hot tub foot
12179,"pssst listen to this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtV80ZdpTY0

the show used to be called Comedy Death Ray and this clip from it is legendary."
12180,"Ding Dong, Piss Pig!"
12181,Jack Bauer he 24 big hit
12182,Always upvote a fellow Piss Pig 
12183,Really? I've listened to every episode of both and CBB is def better imho.
12184,Haven't they expanded to cover the Animal Kingdom as well?
12185,I'm still pruned from the extra long shower I took
12186,That's to bad.  But comedy is almost never universal.  Some things just hit people differently.
12187,It's okay to have crap taste!
12188,"it's VERY hit and miss, but the hits are SO good. find the best ofs that they do every year, and skip straight to the clips"
12189,Celebs are back baby!
12190,"I love that episode so fucking much. It was supposed to just be a quick story time intro before getting into the actual podcast, but ended up being a brilliant full-episode deep dive into the fragility of a man's psyche and the struggle of how to temper or express your emotions as a father with your children present."
12191,Hey Rob Justice is just trying to keep the streets clean of crime
12192,Rob Justice is just as funny a reference as any Always Sunny reference.
12193,That's Rob Justice to you
12194,The birth of Rob Justice
12195,The show also makes so much more sense
12196,Piragua! Piragua! *Piragua!*
12197,It's not your wave bro!
12198,The John Wayne / Marion exchange from the last episode was also fucking hilarious
12199,Do you remember the name of the episode?
12200,There's the one where Glenn is talking about AP bio and robs like AP what? And Glenn starts to say AP and realizes he's being trolled.
12201,Mister Quest? What is that?
12202,"Glenn says something about enjoying live sports.
Rob: I'm kind of doing a whole show about that you know. 

(Welcome to Wrexham is great to be fair and has made a fan out of me)"
12203,I love it when they actually release episodes.
12204,I thought you were cleared of having any donkey brains.
12205,But then they actually do get Lin-Manuel Miranda.
12206,Coming in hot
12207,Wait where?!
12208,"Since I was already writing a reply in my head before I finished reading your comment I'll say Talkville is a pretty fun podcast about Smallville. But, I finished your comment and it doesn't apply. Still a fun podcast with two of the leading actors."
12209,"The episodes do get better. Megan starts directing the discussion a bit more, and it adds a good bit of structure. At the same time, there's enough variety in each episode that it stays fresh imo."
12210,It wouldn't be worth listening to for you.
12211,"It's still good, but it's mostly about the show.

Edit: I don't know why people are downvoting you for asking a legitimate question. Bunch of jibroni's."
12212,"It's not. I fucking love the show, but sometimes the pod is just boring."
12213,">I don't watch IASIP

Well there's your first problem."
12214,"Nope. But if you have the time to spare in your life, I'd recommend you watch the show. Then dive into the podcast if you have further time to spare. It's a great time to be a Sunny fan."
12215,You're in a good position in my opinion. They go through each of the episodes to you could watch an episode of the show and then listen to the corresponding podcast episode. It's kinda like what DVD extras used to be but you've got 4 writers and genuinely funny people doing it.
12216,Wow you sound like a real creep
12217,Did John ever tell you about the time he walked across Europe?
12218,Rudy and his friend Nick.
12219,"GEO-STORM!
GEO-STORM!
GEO-STORM!"
12220,Or they've just run out of low-hanging fruit
12221,"There's one kinda throwaway line in that one that made me laugh so hard, it's near the beginning when Paul is talking about the 23 conspiracy in real life and notes that William S. Burroughs was a big advocate of it, and Jason goes, ""Oh yes, William S. Burroughs, a VERY NORMAL MAN."" For whatever reason that got me."
12222,"I listen to both and love both, plus ""God awful movies"" too"
12223,I agree. A bunch of disgusting shit boys downvoting you.
12224,It still is but it used to be too
12225,Praise good boy Bojangles
12226,I scrolled WAY to far to find TimeSuck mentioned. Been listening since 2017.

12232,Strong pony boy!
12233,"I love This Paranormal Life! My partner pretends he hates it, but always takes the time to roll his eyes at the jokes, so I know he secretly enjoys it."
12234,Really like Timesuck but agree with you Dan can be a little too much at times. Recently this has ruined it for me. Otherwise a very well researched podcast.
12235,The thing I love about Dan is that he appreciates comments like this. He welcomes adverse opinions and wants people to call him out on his shit if he's wrong about something. Truly a great meatsack.
12236,That's how they do it in Hollywood!
12237,"Hey, go jerk your limp Russian shame cock somewhere else!"
12238,"I'm so far behind in my listening, and I'm perfectly fine with that. Just means more to listen to."
12239,Fucking same dude! So many times I've been laughing like a madman in my car.
12240,He was always fiending around the quad 
12241,"Funnily enough last night I sent a heartfelt message to slime on Twitter and ended it with ""thanks man arrite man"" and he blocked me lmao"
12242,Mike Rainey is a treasure.
12243,"It's those months-long story arcs, dude. Pastrami, port-a-potty, endcaps, skateboarding chimp movies, The Tuxedo, the donut shop, Garfield Kart, cheeseburger confidence, and scrumping to name a few,"
12244,And impossible to explain.
12245,"Not to mention, because of the asterisks, it's almost impossible to search for unless you already know where it is."
12246,"Is it any comment mentioning F@#kface or comments on threads specifically about F@#kface? 
 
I really wanna keep my RL status but think I blew it by mentioning FaceJam and F@#kface in this thread."
12247,"Fucking Andrew, dude never pays off his bets."
12248,I love Gus and Geoff but don't care about Austin.  Is it still worth the listen?
12249,"Wouldn't recommend ANMA if you aren't already a fan of Roosterteeth in some way. Most of what they talk about is what Austin/the company/themselves were like from 1997ish to 2013ish.

If you are a fan, it's a fantastic podcast though."
12250,"This is actually a very good description of a show that I thought couldn't be described. Start at the beginning! Also, now I'm a comment leaver I guess."
12251,This is beautiful
12252,"And if you're an old fan with nostalgia for the former RT Podcast, the retelling of old stories, and some new ones ANMA is fantastic. 

Honestly I'd enjoy a lot more of their podcasts but they're too short. 30 minutes is just about where I get engaged so having them that short kind of gives me entertainment blue balls."
12253,"Listen to Face Jam.

And also their other fortnight podcast, Spittin' Silly, which is a Face Jam podcast, but is not the Face Jam podcast."
12254,"Black Box Down is a bit niche, but I really enjoy it as well."
12255,Don't forget Red Web. Pretty much the only RT content I listen to is Red Web and F**kFace
12256,Turn in your shirt
12257,They also just relaunched Always Open.
12258,"No love for Facejam (Michael et al talk fast food), Tales from the Stinky Dragon (Gus, Barb, Blane, Jon and Chris play DnD) or Black Box Down (Gus and Chris talk airline tragedies)?"
12259,"That's Chuntttttt, with six t's."
12260,Aww yeah babyyyy!!
12261,The crossover ep between the two shows is one of the best single podcast episodes I've ever heard.
12262,The Sweater should be in the Library of Congress. Both the episode and the sweater itself.
12263,"It sounds like you've just fundamentally misunderstood what the podcast is trying to do. It's been an improv podcast with riddles as scene-setting since episode 1.

Try Escape This Podcast, maybe. They're audio escape rooms, not QUITE riddles, but riddle adjacent.

I'd also recommend Tom Scott's podcast, Lateral, on which Dani and Bill from Escape This Podcast are frequent guests."
12264,News flash: it's barely a riddle podcast
12265,"So *you're* the one who writes in to complain when they don't do enough riddles, I thought that was just a made up recurring joke."
12266,"""It's ok, I have aids"""
12267,Incredibly tiny penis
12268,Listening to the Conan O'Brien episode and then shortly after listening to the Stephen Colbert episode had me laughing so hard I thought I was going to crash the car.
12269,"Same here. I thought this would be in the top five mentions. Even the episodes where the guest is someone I don't really care about, those three have just such great chemistry that it's still entertaining. Love Smartless."
12270,"Yeah, me too. Smartless is one of the most entertaining podcasts around, and you always get unique perspectives on the interviews too."
12271,"Those were good but the Billy Crudup one was the best I think.

They just rip on each other the entire show and Billy gives as good as he gets :)"
12272,I laughed so hard at Clooney's cat prank story! I replayed that part for my husband and laughed just as hard the second time. Clooney is a gifted storyteller.
12273,"I listen to every episode and I enjoy it -- but I agree on your point about the ""suckoff"" fest. 60% of an episode is just gushing over the celebrity, and god forbid the guest is Canadian. Will Arnett will hog the conversation for a stroll down memory lane and have to discuss every aspect of his Toronto upbringing for 50% of the episode."
12274,It's not meant to be a hard hitting interview show. It's 3 friends having a goof.
12275,"Their history ones are my favorite too, with the Donner Party and Rasputin ones being my two favorite of there's, but they're all amazing"
12276,LOL it took me a minute to remember this

12287,"Love the podcast and I get visibly furious when that awful bit comes up lol.

If someone doesn't know, Last Podcast on the left is True Crime with 3 different personalities.
A dedicated researcher and author.
An improv comedian with a true crime passion
And a full time stand-up style comedian with no idea of the topic.

It's a perfect mix where you can easily connect whether you're in the middle, being grossed out, just interested, or finding the whole thing ridiculous.

My favorite episodes of theirs are on History. The new on Joan of Arc's lesser known, evil, play-producing friend was amazing"
12288,"Just finished the rasputin series relisten, so so good"
12289,"I'll always cherish the memory of the first time I heard Henry doing the scungili man bit while driving home and having to pull over a block from my house cause I was laughing too hard to drive.


That and the ""corn lore"""
12290,"My husband (who hates podcasts and especially hates LPOTL) and I listened to the Rasputin series on a road trip a few years ago and were just crying laughing the whole time. I've listened to the Bell Witch series about four times because it's so fucking hilarious. Not every episode is a winner, but when it's good it's *good*."
12291,Donnor Party episodes are amazing... Jonestown/People's Temple is also incredible.
12292,I grew up in Dulce and know all the theories. I'm gonna have to look into this one.
12293,My favorite is the series on the dinner party. The old prospector voice had my dying
12294,"Ben's reaction to the dogmeat reveal in part 2 is the funniest shit ever. Then later Marcus is listing the reptilian names ffssssszttrrrn and rrrrzzzzssshhhvvt and Ben says ""all better names than Dogmeat"". Might have to listen to that series again today."

12300,Pretty big dill
12301,Hey Margret  Who's your favorite little rascal?
12302,One of my favourite series! So much stuff I didn't know.

12310,"Marcus's ""IS THIS WHAT SIDE STORIES IS?!"" had me crying"
12311,Ben trying to convince the other two that a broken clock is right six times a day is some of the funniest shit I've ever heard.

12314,Side stories...yes...

12318,THERES BONES IN THE CHOCOLATE
12319,"Tbh it's impossible to get into it on any episode before 200. So if you started from the beginning, you're going to have a bad time. They've been doing it for like 12 years now so they've really honed their craft. Depending on where your interests lie, here are some good jump off points:

History: Donner Party, USS Indianapolis, Bonnie and Clyde

Serial Killers: Joseph Kallinger, Yorkshire Ripper, Robert Pickton

Aliens: Men in Black, Tall Whites, Andressean Affair, Betty and Barney Hill

Supernatural/cryptid: Gef the Talking Mongoose, Borley Rectory (may be listed as the most haunted house in England), Bell Witch, Goblin Universe"

12327,"Arnie is the greatest warrior in Foon now, so he's got that going for him."
12328,"Definitely changes! I felt that way for a period of time, but now Chunt boosts him up"

12332,Same. It's my go to for gaming.
12333,"I love them.  I started a few years ago with a few around the time of Henry VIII.  I liked them so I started from the beginning.  I listen to them while I take my daily walk.  Love his style of speaking, the dialog and yes that kind of ramshackle nature of it."
12334,This one is a classic.
12335,Seconding this one! It comes with a good dose of English history as well.
12336,I will take a listen!
12337,Stay noided
12338,I'll check it out
12339,How is it you've come to arrive here?
12340,So many junior juniors.
12341,"I gave Crime in Sports a shot, but after the first few episodes, I had to stop listening. The length of time they spent doing the various ""characters"" like Dexter Manley, Bobby Colorado, The Mexican Pimp, etc. was starting to get way too irritating for my taste. I still have tons of love for STM, though!"
12342,How is it... you've come to arrive here? Get this man a pair of overalls
12343,"As a very much not sports fan, 37 year old woman, I love Crime in Sports!"
12344,Well you need some cheer up bitch
12345,"It's the first crime podcast I saw on the list, so good for them! Brutal murder aren't for everyone."
12346,"I go back and listen to random old episodes. Yesterday I listened like to 68 or something like that and god the quality was horrible. I got my friend into the show and told her the sound gets better, believe me."
12347,Yes! They are incredible. Everyone needs to listen to them!
12348,But are you a scumbag?
12349,"MFM at this point is almost The Beatles or Seinfeld of that genre... it did some things really well, other things not so well, and basically everyone who came after got to learn from both and improve from there."
12350,"I have never understood MFM, and I even tried that before I found STM. It's SO ad-heavy, like thirty minutes of ads and them just kind of BSing at the beginning, then they just sort of do these half ass gloss overs with no real research or anything of the stories. Just terrible and I have absolutely no idea how it has such a massive following."
12351,"Was thinking the same thing. These two are amazing.

You sir ........... can fuck off "
12352,"Yay indeed, Jimmie, yay indeed!"
12353,"It's so good. They do the most research by far of any true crime podcasts. Actual court transcriptions, interrogations, newspapers, books, all the legal filings & appeals records. It's seriously impressive."
12354,Your Own Backyard and The Piketon Massacre are really good ones too.
12355,"Remember, they're assholes but they're not scumbags."
12356,Don't forget the real estate report. Gotta make sure there's a t-bowl for every b-hole
12357,"I thoroughly enjoy when they talk about towns I've been to. I was in Tillamook, OR the week before I heard their episode on it. Fun!"
12358,I've lived in three of the towns they've covered. It's hysterical to hear them talk about the craziness I know all too well.
12359,"There aren't any murders in my tiny little town's past, so the best I get are other towns in my state."
12360,"When I first found them (not knowing I would get absolutely hooked) I would just pick a random episode, but then I realized there were too many call back jokes that I didn't get so I just started at Ep 1. I'm now at about Ep 250. Just hours and hours of hanging out with those two knuckleheads. I feel like I personally know them. 

Jimmie will sometimes slip in the funniest fucking asides that James just rips past without acknowledging, which, I get, he's trying to run the story, but oh my god.  They're both just hilarious.  Seriously in love with them, lol."
12361,Crime in Sports is absolutely worth it. I've been in tears laughing at some of their wrestling and football episodes. They're all entertaining
12362,I just finished it. I tried crime in sports which is good. But there's something about J&J talking gruesome murders that makes me happy so I just restarted the podcast. I used to skip the town stats and all that so now I'm listening to it.
12363,I actually just did this! I binged STM and caught up before I knew it. I started Crime in Sports and it's great! They're coming to the area this summer I can't wait for the live show 
12364,"If its anywhere in the south you're getting a ""so sticky"" no matter what."
12365,Yaayyy and choo choo!
12366,"I like last podcast, but it's just a bit chaotic bc of the fast pace and amount of people talking. I know it's only like 3 guys but they're excited and I just gotta be in the mood for it."
12367,"Late af I know, but It's definitely not just one episode. They do go off topic a lot and it can get kinda boring. 

On one hand I *do* like it more than scripted stuff, because that shit is way too inorganic sounding, but shit I wish they had like a tangent timer to keep things a bit more structured."
12368,That series felt like a cultural moment
12369,"Casts are too hot, old test would fry them"
12370,It's a hot cast. Those are good boys.
12371,Then they shouldn't try cumtown
12372,Calling people normies is dork behaviour.
12373,I just feel like I relate to them more than anyone else. Some of their references are so on the nose with my upbringing it's scary.

12380,"Love PSA the most, but I really do appreciate Pod Save the World for seriously expanding my world view and making me feel that I could actually have an intelligent conversation about world events."
12381,The Pod Save America goons are complete charlatans and morons. They act like politics is just something to play with or have witty bants about like everything is an episode of west wing.
12382,I also love Amicus with Dahlia Lithwick - unparalleled insights and guests from a lifetime reporting on the Court.
12383,Good ole Trolito.
12384,And his dewy septuagenarian skin.
12385,"It's not at all like that. It's very focused on the facts of how the judiciary operates and the cases currently pending or forthcoming, but still in an entertaining and honest way."
12386,It really is.  It's my #1 go-to for science news and the podcast I most look forward to each week.  Not to mention how needed this type of podcast is - so many of us need a reminder to think critically about the world around us.
12387,Me too! It's my favorite
12388,I remember clearly the moment that iTunes and feed update informed me of Perry's passing so many years ago.
12389,"Ologies really fell off for me after the first few years. The interviews and topics, and re-uploads all the time aren't motivating. She used to say ""listen to them all, you never know!"" And I just can't force myself to anymore and nothing has pulled me back to it despite me checking back for episodes I'd like"
12390,I feel similarly about Steve. :)
12391,"Steve, Bob, and Jay Novella, Evan Bernstein, Cara Santa Maria."
12392,"Really? Why?

It's won the People's Choice award several years in a row. They had to actually ask their fans to stop voting for the to give other podcasters a chance to win."
12393,I also want to hear why
12394,Seriously I recommended the former to a friend and was confused when she started talking about the latter
12395,Which is the superior podcast!
12396,Excedra
12397,"I love how it's relevant for almost every fucking media narrative, like, they talk about something and I can find an episode about it"
12398,"The one with the yellow brackets logo, about media criticism"
12399,"Haha nah they criticize media coverage, PR talking points and spin. They go a bit into history. 

In one they delve into anti drug propaganda in Hollywood. I had no idea the Reagan administration would literally edit show scripts having to do with drugs. A lot of the time the writers didn't even know."
12400,"Nah that's Half as Interesting, a YouTube stock footage show"
12401,"Yeah, it lost its way."
12402,are there even new episodes? I swear every one is a rerun
12403,"YES! My partner and I were lamenting this fact the other day.

Maybe I'm not listening to enough of the new episodes but we got the impression that the new hosts seem to be picking their topics based off of an agenda. Like, they know they want to talk about civil rights so they intentionally pick a story or topic that aligns to that.

Not that I have a problem with that, per se, but there are already plenty of podcasts that do this.

Whereas, I always at least FELT like Jad and Robert's topics were just wild, cool, or cerebral things that they randomly stumbled into and then turned into amazing episodes."
12404,"It just wasn't the same without Robert, I barely listened after he left. Now that Jad is gone too I think I'm done."
12405,"Like someone said in another comment, I started waaaay back because I'm a completionist, and have been slowly getting to the present  But I've only just reached June 2020 and am dreading the fact that I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.  It's basically a race between me and Spotify for when a new episode releases, it gets rid of an older episode."
12406,Agree with that for sure.
12407,"Yeah, I gave up on it now that Jad is gone. Started to go down when Robert left but now it's mostly them just replaying the originals that were so good. I highligh recommend anything before like, 2020ish. Great show!"
12408,Still better than it was in 2016. But yes I miss them. But that was a horrible year for the show
12409,What topic was the episode on?
12410,"I too have been a victim of the Gell-Mann Amnesia. It ruins a lot of things, not just podcasts."
12411,"Even before that I found it difficult to get into anymore, way too many were just old episodes repackaged."
12412,Agree
12413,Their fucking editing is INFURIATING. I absolutely cannot stand anything by radiolab.
12414,Bingo. It's like everyone on the show only has lungs for a 3 word sentence and someone else picks up where they left off. Brutal.
12415,so many fucking bleeps and bloops and shit
12416,"Should be way closer to the top. 
His ones on alcohol, caffeine, and sleep have all been so useful for me!

And for whoever said he sounds like if Henry Rollins was a neuroscientist, spot on! Should definitely check out a Andrews appearance on Toby Morse's One Life One Chance podcast too."
12417,It's so dense with info I feel like I should be taking notes when listening
12418,Looks the part too
12419,[deleted]
12420,"Can you offer examples? Also can you define ""bro science""?"
12421,"Yeah, every motivational video I watch now just sounds like ""You can do it!"". But Andrew actually gives advice."
12422,I guess they haven't listened to his thoughts on weed...
12423,"At the end of the day he is pushing people to take their health into consideration, exercise, go outside, and watch what they eat. Absolutely a net positive to listen to. Especially considering a majority of the population doesn't give this stuff much thought."
12424,"He was a guest on a favorite podcast of mine and if you omitted the charming stories and banter all he brought to the table was that it's good to drink coffee in the morning (but not too much) and that stretching and meditation are key for achieving your goal of feeling better. That's it.

Now that he has recently signed a deal with Joe Rogan's merchandise company I imagine that the fountain of youth supplements are not far away."
12425,He has 90% good advice 10% not so good. Just do your research on what he recommends
12426,Yeah if you're taking life advice from a podcast you got bigger issues
12427,[deleted]
12428,And they just came out from behind the paywall! Thank God!
12429,I feel bad bu I've basically stopped listening to Snap Judgment and exclusively wait for Spooked 
12430,Man that episode with the social services worker checking in on the kid who said he was playing video games with another boy who lived in the woods STILL haunts me.
12431,I stopped listening years ago because it's so awful and robotic.
12432,I *heard* this
12433,"That's how I found Unexplained. Same type of content, but I like Richard Maclean Smith's narration much more."
12434,"And the episodes are so short. He's basically like

""Have you ever heard of this weird thing that happened? Well it did. Spoooooky""

Like, okay, but I'd like to hear more about the topic, or discuss it, or anything. It's like reading the first part of a Wikipedia article and ignoring the other 7 parts."
12435,"Its funny you say that, because thats what I like about it. Different strokes for different folks :)"
12436,"I've noticed a lot of mystery themed youtubers have some weird way of talking. There's one channel where the guy says everything in groups of like five syllables. He doesn't group the words together into coherent thoughts or anything, just syllables. A lot of them just aren't good at English as well. Not that it's their second language or anything, they just use awkward wordings or completely the wrong word sometimes.

Makes me wonder if there's some connection between being interested in spooky mysteries and poor communication skills."
12437,I can't do it. It's unlistenable to me because of how he speaks
12438,"He mispronounces a LOT of stuff too. The one that I still haven't forgotten for years was pronouncing the composer Sibelius ""Sib-uh-Lee-us""."
12439,"I don't mind hearing it, but if I listen too long I start to think in Aaron-beats."
12440,What's the deal with this? It's so unnatural lol. Is it how he reads?
12441,He's perfect for falling asleep to though!
12442,Kind of reminds me of the woman who narrates that show Snapped. Just robotic and has the exact same cadence. Every verbal paragraph ends....*with a dramatic PAUSE*
12443,"Glad I'm not the only one who feels this way. He tries to oversell the spooky-voice, and it gets annoying."
12444,This is what 1.5x speed is for. Or more
12445,"I never understood this. I like it, it sets the mood."
12446,"A friend of mine teaches a college speech class. She used Lore for a bit as an example of how not to talk to an audience, because they'd be more focused on how you talk than what you say."
12447,Happens with me and my (nonetheless beloved) Karina Longworth
12448,I tried giving it a shot recently and couldn't handle his cadence either.  Had to stop.
12449,"I think I made it through one episode. I could not listen to him speak any longer, it made me feel like my brain was being poked with a hot stick."
12450,It's oddly hypnotic to listen to him reading Mary Shelley's Frankenstein though on audiobook. Perfect narration.
12451,"Yeah, the cadence is infuriating."
12452,Is it actually a person speaking? I listened to it a couple times and thought it was a computer doing text to voice
12453,If you like folklore podcasts I recommend Myths and Legends
12454,I can't take his constant use of pseudo philosophy and intellectual cliches.
12455,I highly suggest Unexplained if you enjoy Lore and CoC.
12456,Love Myths and Legends! Makes me feel like I'm a kid being read a bedtime story
12457,My all time favorite podcast!
12458,Clancy Brown absolutely killed it last season.
12459,There was one story about the doll where I was like this is too far fetched even for lore and sure enough most of the content was fluffed up big time. I started listening to myths and legends after that and never went back to lore. To be clear I know it's not all real but I couldn't find any accounts of the way he told the story online it's almost as if he made his own lore just to put on the podcast
12460,"By production quality I don't specifically mean audio quality, I mean overall production. Like for Fall of Civilizations they'll have regional music playing lightly in the background to set the scene, or he'll be describing an ancient marketplace and it'll be accompanied by the sounds of clinking coins and a bustling crowd, or when there's different documents written by people relevant to the events being covered they'll have a different voice actor for each one to read the text from the document, or if something is in a different language they'll have someone who speaks the language read it in that language before starting with the English translation. Stuff like that."
12461,"Yep! The podcast is deeper discussions on horror films, conversations about topics like trans representation in horror, and the occasional game Chelsea invents. I honestly prefer it to the kill counts!"
12462,It's so nice seeing so many others outside their sub know about them!
12463,"Ooooh I do enjoy the Quanta Science Podcast, which appears to be the article in the magazine read out in podcast form. 

I'll definitely check out Physics Frontiers, thanks for the recommendation! And in terms of podcasts where the hosts are clearly experts in their academic discipline, I know Vincent Racaniello hosts a variety of podcasts with other guests under the umbrella of 'This Week in Microbiology' or 'Virology' or 'Evolution' and possibly others. He and his panel of other experts select a couple of articles published each week and dissect them, discussing the implications, what could have been done differently, etc. These are definitely geared towards listeners with background knowledge in and interest in biology/microbiology, so if that's not your cup of tea idk if you would enjoy those podcasts though."
12464,LOVE your username btw :D
12465,"Agreed - it sort of reminds me of Jimmy Fallon where everything his guest talks about is his favorite thing.

I also feel like after so many episodes that they are kinda scraping the bottom of the barrel for different topics. While I don't mean to denigrate anyone's area of expertise... a few of the episodes really felt flimsy at best and instead were just promoting junk pseudoscience under the guise of being an ""ology""."
12466,That's a great Australian accent you have there
12467,"""Dismayed but undeterred"" seems like it could be the title of a teacher's memoir."
12468,I absolutely hate most of his guests and have aborted some episodes because of them. They rarely add anything worthwhile.
12469,Same. It's because he's autistic af lol.
12470,Is it these products and services?
12471,It's definitely not Blue Apron. I heard they have an island where you can hunt children.
12472,"You'd think this joke would get old, but I literally laugh at it every time."
12473,Ol shatter hands?
12474,Tasty Doritos
12475,"Bagels! Creamer! Machetes! Child-hunting islands!

Oh wait"
12476,Cool Ranch Doritos?
12477,Raytheon?
12478,or do pretty much anything on communists.
12479,And claymore: fuck anyone in front of you!
12480,I was shocked to find out that missile actually exists
12481,...Iain M Banks knife missile? The Culture?
12482,I heard he would take a bullet for you... ^^Babe.
12483,"I'm not sure if this is a reference to something or not but I'm reading his first book, a (brief) history of vice. There's a couple pictures of him and he's just a tall skinny white dude"
12484,Another great one is the story of L Ron Hubbard. Fascinating
12485,Give the cum doctor episode a try. John Harvey Kellogg.
12486,I love the ones about toxic wellness culture.
12487,Hilarious is not a word I've often seen used in relation to Heydrich.
12488,"I really like Mr Ballen and I've noticed this too, but I also appreciate that he allows these very brief asides to allow full accessibility to the topic - they're not always as simple and universally understood as weed or McDonald's, but occasionally he will explain something I didn't previously understand, and it only takes a moment."
12489,Also too much celebrity life alternative reality. Funny most of the time though.
12490,I listen on Amazon Music app now and there are no ads and it comes out a week earlier. This may require Prime tho.
12491,Colbert's story about Conan is great
12492,You'll be fine. Be sure to stop in an say hello to management.
12493,"Have you checked out their book that goes along side the podcast, ""You Feel it Just Below the Ribs""? It's amazing and adds a lot of interesting details to the world it takes place in."
12494,"I second this as a wtnv fan.  Old gods is nice because you can listen in story arcs

Also wolf359, gave me a similar feel to wtnv"
12495,"It takes a while. I'm about halfway through it at this point, so I don't remember exactly how many episodes. Thing is, essentially all the wacky vignettes slowly start to interact with each other. In that way it kind of eases you into it actually having a story."
12496,"The main element (the love story that anchors the series) develops within the first 10 episodes, if you ask me."
12497,"I'm the same, although I listened to about 120 episodes. It doesn't get any better IMO. I just found it to be easy listening while I'm doing other things, but it's not something I'd recommend investing any time in if it's not grabbing you already."
12498,"They have pretty regular story arcs even starting in the first ""season"". And they develop a lot of their characters so there isn't really anything wasted on long-time listeners."
12499,I would just listen to their 2 part episode called The Sandstorm even if you don't want to check out the entire podcast.
12500,I started listening to the beef and dairy network podcast a couple of days ago. I wasn't sure of it at first but a couple episodes in they did a memorial episode for a meat beast disaster in a town where everyone was a candle seller. That's the episode that sold me on it. Rich Beef Sausages.
12501,My urge to listen to music
12502,"Respect honestly! 
I've only gotten thru episode one since I have a shot attention span I'm juggling a few pieces of media at the moment."
12503,For people who like rules being taken seriously I'd add Find the Path. It's a more low key vibe than Glass Cannon but Rick (the GM) has managed some of the very best reveals and heel turns I've ever heard in an actual play podcast.
12504,Satisfactory!
12505,NADDPOD is an incredible podcast. There's so much content and their Short Rest podcast (unfortunately it's only for Patreon subscribers) is a godsend for new DMs to get a peer into the mind of a good DM
12506,"You'll like dimension 20, generally anything withh Brennan Lee Mulligan is gonna be a good time. Start with Escape from The Bloodkeep if you decide to check it out. All else fails, Tiny Heist also involves the McElroys."
12507,I thought the same thing until I found Dungeons and Daddies. I was hooked by the first episode and it had me in laughing tears within the first 5 or so episodes.
12508,"Problem is arc 1 was considered some of the best podcasting in history, but that was 5+ years ago & it's dropped off in popularity significantly since then."
12509,"I live for the Poll Report, the intro jingle to which is the *entire Polish national anthem* (which it turns out is fucking long)"
12510,"I believe his degree showed up earlier this year, ha. For anyone giving this one a try, I recommend starting with Night of the Grizzlies. It really showcases Wes's storytelling skills and knowledge."
12511,Michael Douglas?
12512,"I, too, have a thousand island stare."
12513,Is your dick also small?
12514,This. So much this.

12516,"He's sleeping in the great laundry basket in the sky, now. RIP."
12517,TAFS studios will grow into being the next Disney channel.
12518,Stav was just a living laugh track anyways. It's basically the nick mullen autistic podcast featuring a bug.
12519,"How much does that matter? Tons of backlog

But my reasoned take is that stavs solo stuff is better than anything cumtown ever did"
12520,I could listen to Sona cracking up all day.
12521,I really wish he had one with Norm :(
12522,In a raspy voice
12523,Cadacai!
12524,"My favorite episode is the one he did with Stephen Colbert. Anytime either of them are interviewing the other, it's magical."
12525,When he mispronounced her name and she corrects him... LOL https://youtu.be/C-pxjhLib3w
12526,clown honking intensifies
12527,have that episode saved for a rainy day
12528,Its really blown up in the last couple of years. It pretty regularly hits the top 100 these days.
12529,">it feels almost voyeuristic, like I shouldn't be privy to their conversations. 

I could see that. I'm usually thinking how the advice could be applied to my own relationships instead of listening as an eavesdroper of sorts.

>I don't like the pride she takes in not knowing something and having no interest in looking it up/ learning about it. 

To be fair, i think some of this is just a bit for a comedic effect."
12530,Same. I've learned so much about myself by just listening these sessions.
12531,"I lost it in that Work of Fart skit where Travis managed to come up with ""A Streetcar Named Deez Nuts"""
12532,"YouTube as well, it's technically a polygon series but Monster Factory makes me laugh so hard I cry"
12533,I feel you. This week or last they even got a bit meta with it and talked about how they need it after the break to kill time. I wish they'd just do more questions like they used to! It's down to one or two per Ep now...
12534,"Ya I'm with you there, it can still be hilarious but there really just aren't that many more shocking things a restaurant can do. They peaked with the chicken wars"
12535,SQUAD
12536,Is it about that terrible battle against the Borg?
12537,Yes! One of my favorite podcasts ever
12538,"We're Alive (the first season) was so good! I didn't like Goldrush or the latest one, Descendants."
12539,EDGE
12540,"I think I heard a little about Get Played ages ago when it was How Did This Get Played, still yet to listen to much of it"
12541,EDGE
12542,"I love Get Played. Heather, Matt and Nick are cool.


 I'll go back and listen to Heather's retelling of  ""Evo moment 37""often. Her explanation of the parry gives me goosebumps every time I hear it."
12543,Wouldn't have it any other way
12544,"Doughboys

12545,"Agreed. It was my first horror podcast, and after finishing it, for a while I'd google some top 10 lists for horror podcasts and check out the ones that appeared on multiple lists. But nothing was on the same level as TMA. Legitimately one of the most well written pieces of fiction I've ever consumed. I seriously hope Johnny (Jonny?) Sims goes on to write for film or tv."
12546,"It's not horror, or an audio drama (strictly) but I'd argue Rusty Quill Gaming is of similar quality to Magnus. Basically the same people (the VAs for Martin, Melanie, Elias) and a similar level of writing/performance.

It was their first work so takes a bit longer to establish itself, but overall I actually miss it more than Magnus. I'd be *way* more excited for a new season of RQG with the same cast than I am for the new Magnus spin-off."
12547,"Why yes I do, lol"
12548,"That's exactly why I love it, too. You don't even have to be a history buff to get a full appreciation of the topic. Plus, I've never not laughed at loud multiple times an episode.

Edit: typo"
12549,"I like too (and love the Infinite Monkey Cage). I just find it funny how BBC Radio 4 seems to have a myriad of ""What if we put an expert and a comedian together?""-type of podcasts/shows."
12550,I'll give that a listen. Thanks for the recommendation!
12551,The Life Scientific is good as well
12552,The one about the Segway!!
12553,"I used to hang out with this boy, we called him mud chicken. He only had 4 fingers and was 8 feet tall. He and I would go out into the woods and throw a bucket of chicken into the swamps, wrestle for it. By the time we were done, the chicken would be covered in mud. If no one won, we'd jerk off and whoever finished first won the chicken."
12554,Stavvy!
12555,"Stav has his own podcast, Stavvy's world"
12556,"And the soundboard thing:

12557,Legend!
12558,It's one the best!!
12559,I'm definetly gonna have to give this one a listen
12560,I'm still looking for the yard 
12561,"Kind of a tangent but it's the same for me with ""Cortex,"" CGP Grey's podcast. In theory it's about productivity and I got into it because they reviewed Apple products and I was a fanboy for a bit, but in practice it has become *heavily* meta-focused on their own podcasting/YouTube business. At some point I just thought, ""why am I even listening to this? These productivity problems have no relatability to my life."""
12562,"If you ask me there is value in that, sometimes I don't want to think and just want to have a laugh.

At the end if the day if I enjoyed it, I would say it's time well spent. I don't always need to gain something."

12574,Sounds like you

12579,Hail you!
12580,"The Chilluminati Podcast with Mike ""Mathas"" Martin, Jesse Cox, and Alex Faciane is that same niche as well. They're well researched and funny as hell."
12581,"I've heard that LPOTL fans generally like Timesuck, I'll have to check it out. Thanks!"
12582,I'll look into this one. Thanks!
12583,Came here for kingslingers. It's brilliant 10/10 would recommend
12584,"Kingslingers is great. The first season is working through The Dark Tower series and then they cover Dark Tower adjacent books. I really like The Kingcast too, they mostly cover film adaptations of King books with interesting guests and they even had Stephen King himself on for an interview"
12585,"I am also a gigantic King fan! I did a full publication order reread, and got into Derry Public Radio due to that. Kingslingers I found during the pandemic and CANNOT say enough good things about that podcast! The guys are funny and well read, and it's a great format for discussion."
12586,"This is one I'll have to check out!

Someone else mentioned Kingcast in this thread, that's another good one."
12587,The trail by fire... ants was rigged
12588,Good morning Julia
12589,We'll yeah you made her watch people die
12590,My wife and I are hoping to catch him in August at Vegas
12591,Are you one of those fat poors?
12592,"For me, it's Christinas deranged takes on shit that puts me off. They'll see something about concrete evidence for X and she'll be like 'Yeah but Y is really what's right, because I'm Hungarian'."
12593,"Howd you get a job here, fuck face?"
12594,Mean? To Christina or to everyone?
12595,"This is why I haven't gotten into this podcast. I can listen to him and Bert be dinguses for a while on 2 Bears 1 Cave, until Bert finally annoys the shit out of me. I saw Tom live last year and the amount of ""alpha men"" in the crowd who knew him from his podcasts was very disappointing"
12596,Don't forget Magnus Archives
12597,saving this entire thread for horror recs for when i work the night shift.
12598,I literally finished listening to the podcast and i still crave more
12599,"David talking about the ""cream pie"" on the set of a porno is fucking hilarious. Something about his dry humour just fucken sends me."
12600,Arm chaired and Dangerous is amazing too. Love David Farrier.
12601,"You're not wrong, it is. The demographics of armchair expert however are wildly different than that of Reddit."
12602,I think they moved to Spotify exclusively
12603,Yeah he is but I still think some of them are on zoom. And the Kelly Slater episode they flew to Hawaii to talk with him in person
12604,They had Rick on their podcast too and he was fascinating. Dax and Rick have a really good way of interacting with each other.
12605,Co-host is Monica Padman!
12606,"She explains this in the next appearance- i'd be curious to know where you get those adjectives from, i didnt get that vibe whatsoever. But yeah, a) she helped put it together- straight up got him guests and encouraged them because she believed in them. B) She also did not want to go on the podcast and be some kind of pushover and she knew exactly what he wanted the show to be, so she was trying to to push back and be on her toes."
12607,I suspect people are sharing the lesser known podcasts on this thread because too many big ones are far down.
12608,Absolutely love the fan ones! Conan is such an authentic down to earth person. Kinda would love to try to do one with him but also terrified I'd say something stupid.
12609,Wull
12610,Agreed
12611,Just waiting for them to have 5 people on total and have them mix it for 5.1 surround so that they can each be talking in a different channel at the same time
12612,It's so good and s o underrated! I've been following it for years I adore it sm
12613,If you ever figure out what it's called PLEASE let me know that sounds so cool!
12614,The food hot takes are my favorite parts.
12615,"I think if it was an actual anime podcast, it would've died a long time ago. The amount of anime talk they have rn is just right for me, mostly only comes up when something significant happens in the industry or they have a guest and ask about their favourite shows.

I'm here for Garnt's and Connor's shitty food takes."
12616,"I started that one and my wife pulled me away.

I'm also watching a long as he and Tom Welling go back through Smallville."
12617,"Highly recommend the short rest episodes too, they can be even funnier than the main feed."
12618,The 2nd campaign took a while to really blossom but the 3rd has been super good!
12619,"I also didn't love the follow-up campaigns and skipped out on Trinyvale and Eldermourne within 10 episodes each, but the current campaign makes a return to Bahumia and it's been excellent"
12620,I said don't sing yet!
12621,I tried to figure out how to write his laugh out but I don't think it can be done.
12622,"I find anything I laugh at a lot, comedy. I think that is what most people think of. They definitely laugh at each other, but nobody laughs at themselves. The three of them taking the piss out of each other is the funniest part, but a funny guest helps."
12623,Why we he send you a sweet slice of t-shirt cheese (could he afford it?)
12624,"No. Sometimes the podcast is expanding on topics covered on the show, sometimes covering entirely separate topics. Definitely worth your time."
12625,I'm not sure actually...
12626,Hold on Dude
12627,"I really enjoyed Tanis at first, and I listened to quite a few seasons of it. But eventually I just got a bit frustrated and exhausted with it. It seemed like the writers were just meandering around and didn't seem to have much idea of where to go with the storyline. Big revelations often ended up going no-where. The pacing was also increasingly irritating - ""it's complicated"". I think they should have had a tighter storyline limited to a few seasons.

I'll check out the others though so thanks for the recommendations! 

You might also want to check out Limetown - a mystery horror about the mass disappearance of a small town's population."
12628,"They also do it respectfully. I was listening to the 9/11 episodes again and they joke about how different airport security was pre 9/11, and they joke about how dumb the terrorists were, but they don't make fun of the victims or the day. All 3 of the guys talked about how emotional it was to research that series and they take it very seriously."
12629,"As a former Mormon, their series on Mormonism was indeed pretty well researched. The only stuff they got wrong was stuff you could basically only know by being in the religion for many years."
12630,"""STOOOP"""
12631,Probs cause it ended in 2019 but I agree it should still get love. I feel like I watch the Werewolf episode like every 3 months
12632,"Me too!! I ended up having to search the comments lol. 

I really like the balance of the hosts especially after the transition that has to happen with the trade out of the second host."
12633,Movie reviews of the movies you love to hate. Gotta be 40% or lower on rotten tomatoes but there are some real gems and maybe some movies you haven't seen yet.
12634,Litterally! dont forget to submit a review!
12635,You're ass off right now
12636,"I'm on the fence about Descendants, it's great, but it doesn't have the same feel as the original. That said, 14 years, dozens of characters, fantastic sound design, original concepts, and a production value that makes since Netflix originals look like fanfics. If society actually respected podcasts as a media, this would be a foundational piece of media culture."
12637,They go into so much depth that most shows don't.
12638,Technicality no down boo over!
12639,"Well, some of them takes forever for an update. And I don't listen to every episode of every one. For example, I only occasionally listen to Let's Learn Everything."
12640,"Oh yeah, 1.5x and 2x speed helps."
12641,Oh it's on The List. It's been in there a while though so I should finally give it a go.
12642,That's on The List too! I just haven't gotten to it yet. Listening while sleeping though?? That's a level I never reach.
12643,"I definitely will, thanks! I like the premise. I love podcasts where the hosts have a genuine curiosity for everything and the podcast is their outlet. I learn so many random things I wouldn't have otherwise, so yours sounds up my alley."
12644,"It's the one where British school faculty targeted Pakistani immigrants/decedents after they improved their kids school scores too much, because xenophobia."
12645,"I'll add it to The List, thanks!"
12646,"1x sounds like people are talking through mud to me. My partner and I have to compromise at 1.2x which sounds like regular conversation speed to me. He refuses to go any faster because it messes with the pitch, which is valid but not enough for me to slow it down. 

Swindled is definitely on The List. 
I have a whole folder (thank you Pocket Casts) for scams, cults, and scandals."
12647,Medical + history with bonus comedy sounds perfect. It's on The List!
12648,Multitasking. Gotta keep my mind engaged so I don't ADHD zone out or get sidetracked. I also have an online job and listen to everything sped up.
12649,"To add on: the mood and conversations can vary episode to episode. Generally they're either funny or sad, sometimes just simply lighthearted and interesting. Chris Gethard is a fantastic host who is equal parts funny and empathetic."
12650,Upvoting for Magnus
12651,"Frontpage redditors hate it for some reason

I think they equate the podcast with the most annoying online tankies"
12652,Redditors want to pretend it didn't exist lmao.
12653,"Also the first time I saw q anon anonymous 

How tf, those two are among the largest shows on patreon. They can't be *that* niche on reddit of all places lmao"
12654,"When they were saying shit nobody was saying, they were cool.  Now they're saying the same shit they've always said, so it's boringer."
12655,It's time to pay the ferryman
12656,Lots of reruns.  I miss Robert.
12657,Don't sing yet!
12658,You both present *sick* arguments
12659,"I gave Stavvy's World a try and now I question everything about you...

... He's a decent third mic, not a host."
12660,"AKA you can't cope with even slightly differing viewpoints, no matter how well reasoned or thought out."
12661,[deleted]
12662,"They deepthroat the Koch brothers at one point, among other issues. There's certainly at least some reason."
12663,Amazed how far buried in this thread this is! Only podcast that's been able to retain my attention for more than a few episodes
12664,Yes! Its basically those videos but with the raw take and much longer
12665,DUDESY muuggs. Latest episode is an absolute gem
12666,"Absolutely. I think I'm judging based on both entertainment and information density. Dan Carlin tends to follow this pattern of telling you something, reading the source, and then summarizing what he just told you again. Darryl zooms in pretty close on topics like the civil rights movement or Jim Jones and can still take on more ephemeral topics like cannibalism and human sacrifice. BTW - That series on Jim Jones is the best story I've ever heard in my life - It's like The Wire of podcasts."
12667,"Car? Boca Raton? No, don't think I've heard about this.. /s"
12668,You won't regret it.
12669,Thank you. You clearly do too.
12670,Their internal ads
12671,"Right?

How many times has she said ""those people"" when countering a point?

She annoys the shit out of me as well. 

But I am surprised how far I had to scroll to find this podcast."
12672,How is the #1 podcast in the world this far down?
12673,"/u/Schubes17 we love your shit, you big ole nerd "
12674,thank you!
12675,"I don't know but you'll absolutely love it.  She has two full seasons, so enjoy!!!"
12676,"* Winding Road
* Black Caviar
* Sugar Plum Sunset

Go!"
12677,"Jonathan ""Lot Kid"" Larroquette JR will go down in history as our generations Divinci. I just hope he gets that truck for all the work he does"
12678,There's substance because Lex gives his guest plenty of time to talk. And Lex is a calm chill dude so I find that kind of nice. It's like the joe Rogan podcast if joe Rogan forgot to eat his elk meat that day and his t levels fell to a more appropriate level
12679,"Lex is very chill and pretty introverted, which can make it difficult to see interest if you're used to explosive enthousiasm. But there are certain episodes that I've seen that made it clear to me that he is the most interested host from any podcast I've seen."
12680,"He's got relatively shallow knowledge of a relatively large number of topics, but he's obviously educated enough to hold a conversation with every public figure, intellectual, scientist, or performer he interviews. It makes the show very interesting. One week you could have an entertainer or lawyer, and the next one someone that works at CERN or SETI or something. He's had many incredible guests with wildly different professions, opinions, interests, and levels of influence, and very few of his shows have been less than interesting or would somehow make him less than reputable, IMO."
12681,"It's just his voice. He has an almost sedated way of speaking. But make no mistake, he is interested in his guests and the topics. He's just super low key and humble in his presentation which I can see coming off as disinterested.

In other words, give it another shot. There's some fascinating guests. Some I've enjoyed lately:  


Chris Voss - hostage negotiator

David Kipping - astrophysics / planet discovery

MrBeast - surprisingly interesting deep dive into what makes content go viral online

Daniel Negreanu - one of the best poker players of all time discusses the field"
12682,I wanted to like him but was unpleasantly surprised
12683,"That's true, Reddit doesn't have good tastes I'm afraid  they out here beating up anyone that says Joe Rogan, i saw someone start with ""joe-"" and they fucking killed him before he finished saying it, he wasn't even going to say Joe Rogan"
12684,
12685,I think that Reddit handle is Dusty.
12686,I fuckin love mean boys. Saw em live when they came they came to Florida. Miss that podcast.
12687,"I really liked Jordan watches a star war. I came in and out of the rest of the show. Still love all those dudes and fifi. I hope they're all doing well. 
I had the same experience with unpops but now all their shows are on separate feeds, so you can just follow the ones you like.

Agreed on comedy. Mean boys perfected it. Nobody else has come close to making me laugh as hard."
12688,"I was surprised I couldn't find him too. He was the first podcaster to interview a sitting president with Obama and I know other comics have even tried copying his intro monologue style. I get it though, not everyone wants bleak but I love it. I'm just happy I'm not getting unrealistic optimism and hearing from someone that says what I'm already thinking. And he doesn't bring that into his interviews at all which is perfect for person to person talks. Definitely cried when he sang his song at the end of one as a tribute to Lynn too. 

He's definitely one of my favorite comics. I'm in LA and have seen him multiple times at the Comedy Store and seen him at his private show he talks about sometimes. Still haven't seen his newest HBO special for some reason though."
12689,Hasent talked about him in depth in a while.  A lot of stuff of AI and the near future or tech.  Interesting stuff.
12690,"Ah the so the TDS crowd arrives. The real Trump Derangement Syndrome was believing in his sorry ass in the first place, and that he gives a single iota about anyone but himself"
12691,"Tanis?! I thought you said ""tennis""."
12692,"Nic, I'd like you to come work for me."
12693,"we will be dead soon, don't worry"
12694,"Whenever i see people shitting on such a nice person, I can't help but feel bad for them. It doesn't reveal anything positive about your character. And you are oblivious to that fact."
12695,Agreed
12696,Yeah the fact that Grey will go out of his way to not address the show like banning anyone mentioning the show on his subreddit has soured things for me.
12697,More people to tell Andrew to eat the pencil
12698,YOU'RE GODDAM RIGHT!
12699,Oh of course.
12700,"Yeah true. But it is great for long car rides. 
I almost always learn something that I end up making conversation about whenever I get to where I'm going."
12701,"Couldn't agree more. They somehow mix hilarious and really throught provoking takes often in the same breath and I think their chemistry always just flows so well. I recommend it all the time, but I think ""another gaming podcast"" is kind of a hard sell to some people."
12702,Ya I haven't listened to any of those yet I'll have to start
12703,Suckin fat titties
12704,"Thank you.    
I've never heard of ""Risk"" but I'll give it a shot. I used to spend a great deal of time in my car so I listened to NPR a lot. They have ""The Moth Radio Hour"" which is also a live story telling format by audience members, so I think I'll probably dig ""Risk"". I'm also a huge fan of the TED Radio Hour, basically anything that gets me thinking and learning, and looking at things in a new way."
12705,Helped acquit a man who was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
12706,I got their book lmao
12707,Hells yeah.
12708,Absolutely! Even the darker episodes are interesting
12709,"Same, I usually don't enjoy podcasts but his are so easy to listen to. I listened to the Xbox hacking episodes on a flight once and they were so awesome that it made a 4 hour flight feel like 20 minutes. 

As messed up as it sounds I hope he doesn't get too popular, he's perfect where he's at"
12710,"I just had to look that up, I didn't even know about it. Why would that make you take a break out of interest? 

Have you seen Beef yet?"
12711,The parallels with what is happening now is creepy.
12712,No! Jamie Jeffers
12713,"I havent listened to either of them, any specific episodes that Ishould start with?"
12714,:)
12715,All else is groupthink
12716,Hail yourself!
12717,Paranormal Commune Assemble!
12718,"Honestly thats the point.  He's a normal idiot talking with people far beyond him most of the time.  He knows that.  He says that often.  And sometimes he gets caught up in his own stupid and he knows that too.  But because of his humility and willingness to talk to people he gets on some of the best guests from all walks of life.  

If you think the Joe Rogan Experience is about Joe Rogan, I'd say you've missed the point completely."
12719,"He gets the best guests of any podcast out there, except for maybe Marc Maron. But the long format and relaxed nature of it really lets certain guests get comfortable and ramble about the things their passionate about. Obviously when the guest is a lunatic or an idiot, its not so great. But there are a lot of intellectuals, academics, weird niche people, comedians, fighters--everything you could imagine. And hearing them in an informal setting is really cool a lot of times"
12720,Joe interviews so many people that you there is bound to be a guest or two who you will actually enjoy.
12721,Joe Rogan is the Oprah of podcasts.
12722,[deleted]
12723,Whatever guests he has that might be great to listen to will show up on someone else's podcast who will do a better job interviewing them.
12724,Strange though as he was right when looking back at it.
12725,"Yea, lots of tistic screeching every time his name is brought up here"
12726,"That's kinda self defeating.  If Joe wasn't the way he was the podcast wouldn't be the way it is.  If you don't like aspects of Joe that's totally fine, but did you ever consider that perhaps those very aspects also play a role in allowing him to make the podcast the way it is?"
12727,"Do you think that every episode consists of him talking about covid and politics? Lol, it's crazy that you even correlate Joe Rogan to Donald Trump in your head"
12728,"The only medical advice Joe Rogan has given is that working out is good for you and supplementing your diet with vitamins has benefits.   

Which one of those do you disagree with?"
12729,I only listen to Joe when he has someone on that's worth listening to
12730,See i used to feel the same way but looking back i think maybe it was more a case of me getting better taste rather than joe getting worse (although i think its a mix)
12731,"I'm torn because he wasn't too bad mid-2010s and to this day, I still love his fight commentary. But man, things went downhill fast 2020 and onward."
12732,Just recently he was drinking Budweiser and making fun of the type of people who drink it. I think one side of the political spectrum just takes things a little more personally than the other.
12733,"Nah,  the country continues to be further divided due to far left radical agendas going mainstream.  It's impossible to sit around and not call out the nonsense.

I feel he goes out of his way to be critical of the right...probably an attempt to be somewhat balanced.

Remember, it's the left that has attacked him repeatedly and unjustly."
12734,"> He was better before he started believing his own hype.

This is just the old ""that band was better when they were still indie, now the fame has gone to their head"".

Or ""that comedian used to be funnier before"".

&nbsp;

It's funny how someone can be a diehard fan of someone one day and then the next day somehow that same person has actually been kinda bad or mid for years.

&nbsp;

I hate when people say that kind of milquetoast dishonest crap because they're trying to pretend to have a less extreme opinion for the sake of optics.

&nbsp;

It was honestly hilarious when people did that shit about James Gunn when they thought his cancellation was gonna stick.  But then suddenly he's uncanceled and still crushing and people just tried to pretend they never took shots at him the moment it looked like he was down."
12735,You don't think people should be able to say what they think?
12736,Build your own and call it whatever you want?
12737,Haha facts. I don't listen as much as I use too. I think it's because he lives in Texas now.
12738,Well that's a fucking strawman. People who don't like him know exactly why they don't like him
12739,"I listened to him for years until mid-2020. You can like him or not, but he definitely changed. Also, he's not funny lol. I do love the protect our parks episodes though. It's great when he brings in people who are funny."
12740,"He's a moron that platforms a lot of nasty shit and nasty characters like Alex Jones. 

I don't need someone to tell me to hate him-I decided for myself."
12741,"Were these ""liberal agency's"" telling me joe Rogan was a mentally disabled unfunny bore for mouth breathers 10 years ago too?"
12742,"Nah, I hate him because he had Robert Malone on and didn't even attempt to push back everytime Malone said something that was a lie or misinformation. There have been similar ones, as well.

He used to offer push back. It used to be discussion. His older stuff is great. But that's where it stops.

Edit: Since this is already getting a few upvotes and seen, here is a video examining Malone's [claims](https://youtu.be/xjszVOfG_wo) on JRE.

Edit 2: JRE smoothbrains out in full force raging at me. See [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/12j384c/whats_a_podcast_actually_worth_listening_to/jg04sw4/) comment for a more in depth breakdown. (Basically the video above in quick link text format if you don't want to or can't sit through the video)"
12743,"OP asked for a podcast worth listening too. Not ""what's an obscure podcast we've never heard of""."
12744,He is objectively unpopular on Reddit though
12745,Lol. It's like when Fox News talks about the MSM as if they don't also claim to be the most watched news network.
12746,People believe he's some very strong conservative person and idk about you but there is a lot of liberal people on Reddit that downvote everything that does not fill their echo chambers in agreement with their opinions
12747,A Open minded individual that is willing to have conversations with people of opposing minds ?
12748,... liberal?
12749,"You absolutely should listen. The shit storm is bs, she's not a bad person at all, just misundersood. And all the best to you and your partner. :)"
12750,"If you took the time to actually listen to the episodes mentioned above, you would probably NOT call her a ""disgusting fucking pig"" anymore."
12751,But she isn't. She's good people.
12752,Blew my mind when I learned it's not actually Rogan that says that bit
12753,Lol
12754,He just drank Budweiser and made fun of the people protesting it. Does that give him a pass?
12755,">I prefer my media a little less ideological

oh the irony"
12756,"We also give aspirin to horses. If he took aspirin for a headache, would you say he was taking horse medicine like a fucking asshole?"
12757,How dare someone like something different than you do!
12758,"Funny, you hear that a lot from Republicans"
12759,"My problem with Joe isn't that he features people I don't want to hear or hate. It's that he says he's an idiot, and then proves it. 

I think he's actually pretty intelligent. He's not stupid, he's a fool. And a fatuous one at that."
12760,It saddens me how we can't even attempt to get along with different views or even debate topics without trying silence each other. Personally I enjoy some of both sides of the spectrum.
12761,Yeah the hate boner reddit has for him is because he has dabbled with both sides which apparently means you are a nazi
12762,Which guest was it? I'm going to listen to it next
12763,"Rogan is worth checking out periodically for me. I am generally bored to death with most of the topics/guests he has, but he pulls some very interesting people and has some very amazing interviews."
12764,"Yeah those are always hilarious, I wish we would've got a season 3 of midnight gospel."
12765,Not very wild considering Reddit is an echo chamber.
12766,"Don't look to Reddit for an accurate representation of the real world, it makes the upvotes and downvotes make a lot more sense."
12767,It wasn't listed at all when I posted.
12768,"For me it wasn't any kind of backlash I just got so sick of his guest list. Comedian, comedian, comedian, comedian, MMA fighter, comedian, comedian, comedian. I'll check in on it once in a while when he finally has a guest I'm interested in but that seems to be like 1 out of every 10 guests lately. I miss the theoretical physicists, scientists, investigative journalists, and other guests similar to those. They seem to be few and far between now."
12769,This comment tells me you've never seen it lol
12770,I think he gained 2 million subscribers and a bunch of views. Over all last year his podcast grew a hell of a lot.
12771,Lol I think that whole fiasco got him like 2 million extra followers or something close to that
12772,I've noticed that.
12773,"The guy is a left-wing druggie, isn't that what Reddit likes? I feel out of touch more and more these days"
12774,"This is so interesting. How on earth did you twist ""not wanting to listen to a man talk for an hour"" to ""people get upset if Joe likes the same thing as they do.""

You have lost the plot and so did Joe tbf."
12775,Maybe there are not but not when i posted
12776,Did CNN write this comment?
12777,Mostly he has comedians. Not that I listen to every episode. He's not anti vaccine at all. You clearly don't know what you're talking about he's quite liberal.
12778,"The Mariana van Zeller one in February was amazing. I guess if you only choose to look at the guests you hate then that's all you will see. There are quite a few interesting ones and yes, quite a few stupid ones. But when your doing multiple a week and your almost on your 2000th episode it gets harder and harder to find new guests"
12779,This post predates those genius
12780,You don't have to sign up. I listen when there is a guest I like and I don't have a Spotify account.
12781,It is now but it was posted after mine
12782,"Yeah, those all were posted after mine."

If I ever mention JRE, I'm typically downvoted for it. 

I think when the thread is specifically about podcasts, it'll draw a more concentrated crowd in to vote. I'm actually surprised at the amount of up votes the JRE people are getting in this."
12786,"I got banned from a subreddit that I'd never even followed, simply because they detected that I'd commented on a post from the joe rogan subreddit. Brother, reddit absolutely fucking seethes when JRE is brought up, quite often hahaa."
12787,Is that why every controversial answer is JRE?

12794,"That's my issue with him. He has zero knowledge on most of the topics which in and of itself isn't a problem, but he never questions anything. It's fine to have a quack guest on now and then but he doesn't differentiate between them and someone who's actually educated in their topic."
12795,I have listened to a few of his older podcasts but I havent really noticed any difference in how he carries out his interviews. I like them all the same. I thoroughly enjoy listening to his new episodes and look forward to them. <3 We need more content like JRE.
12796,Nobody said jack shit about the podcast being obscure. What are you on about?
12797,Who said never heard of?
12798,"The title above you says ""worth listening to"" , not  ""I've never heard of"" 

Are you sure you are on the right thread?"
12799,And if you never watched a film before (podcasts are a relatively new media type for the general public) those are a good place to get started
12800,"Oh fuck off, that's not my point. My point is that Reddit has some sort of hatred towards anything that is remotely popular or mainstream."
12801,"You know that can apply for Joe Rogan fans too, right? Popularity of something doesn't mean it's universally adored. Just look at boy bands or Jesus Christ for examples."

12807,[removed]
12808,"I'd say it's best to start from the beginning. The first couple episodes are really good at introducing the format and context for the series, and are also just good in their own right. It also generally presents as an anthology series, but there are a lot of details or parts of more lore/plot-heavy episodes that get a bit confusing if you listen to them out of order, or especially if you're a first-time listener."
12809,"For me, I'm currently in a knowledge quest, and I find those 2 to be pretty balanced in their content,  guests, and the general over all conversation.  I try to watch a lot of documentaries about a whole huge range of topics trying to get my idiot brain to get smarter. But so many are biased, propaganda,  and some just straight up bullshit.

These two open my mind up to learning,  and then prompt me to then, go on my own and further research topics that are discussed.  Such as the AGI thing.  Holy shit didn't know we were that close!!

Edit: just wanted to give a quick shout out to our soon to be AI overlords."
12810,I dont know exactly how they're related but I'm pretty sure they're sisters

12812,"I had to stop listening because of that. I loved them for so long, but it got to be too much."

12814,What did they do?? I'm a Patreon subscriber
12815,Same lmao it did have 6 up votes  fuck 'em
12816,Yeah he is extremely frustrating and not funny at all. I used to like him way back when but now I can't stand him.
12817,IMO he's hilarious and his show is wonderfully curated. The show has evolved far beyond the early days of him just interviewing guests: there are 9 crew members that bring variety and unique talents to the show. It's now a current events/variety comedy show and it's quite the feat to pump out as much prolific entertaining content that he does. All of this on top of Hila's successful fashion business and them raising two children.
12818,"I just dislike some of shit he says like ""life's too short to excercise"" and he just seems like a bad person based on what I've seen of him."
12819,Insane it got downvoted so hard.   I only added it after scrolling and not seeing anyone else mention it.  I guess Fat Man Bad
12820,"I honestly have to agree.  There's a weird difference between when he talks about psychology/mythology  vs. when he talks about politics.  When he discusses psychology, he is authoritative and well-researched.  And when he talks about politics, and I really hate to say this because I like him, he tends to talk out his ass.  I wish he had stuck with his area of expertise, or at least based all of his political commentary on areas where politics overlaps his expertise.  But nowadays he'll discuss climate change, economic policy, medicine...etc and he doesn't really sound like he knows what he's talking about."
12821,"Nah, the actual leftists got kicked off/quarantined too. It's an echo chamber for the struggle session of the day, as decided by one particular political party and their mouthpieces."

12842,"Shane Sigsbee on Aug 18 2022 is a cool one about a guy who started a company to stake professional poker players. July 14 2022 with a guest named Will is a favorite of mine too if it's the one I'm thinking of.

Not gonna lie they definitely have some dud episodes but they're mostly entertaining with a variety of topics. Mail bag episodes are also entertaining, one of the hosts Richard you can tell gets annoyed by some of the questions and answers them in a ""wow you're an idiot"" type of tone which I think is entertaining."
12843,Not everything is for everyone.
12844,How I made your mother
12845,"Yeah, glass coffee tables, orange wedges, a helicopter ride from Pat McCormick, Uncle Miltie's HUGE penis that he would whip out at every opportunity, the chimpanzee that were trained to preform cunnilingus on wealthy Hollywood housewives, and many others.

It was also nice to hear a lot of the guests complimenting Gilbert: Carl Reiner told Gilbert ""you're both mine, and my son's favorite comedian."" Alan Arkin telling Gilbert ""You're responsible for the funniest joke I ever heard.""

Strawberry malted for guessing/remembering what that joke was?"
12846,"I thought it was Reply-All, but the subject seems way too serious?

I know it was fairly long too, probably too long to fit in one episode?!

It was so long ago... it was so good, and covered all bases so well that it did not require a second listening."

The infrastructure isn't even close yet. I'm telling you. If you want to do the podcast thing. At least use informative ones between
12854,I started the history of Rome in early covid after my ex left and I was raising two kids on my own. Finally picked up Revolutions recently and the second I heard his voice it was like hearing an old friend. Good times.
12855,So you've heard his Hello Fresh ads then?
12856,"Hello, and welcome - to a Publix receipt."
12857,Same way I feel about BRAD NICHOLLS Podcast
12858,"And its so funny, because by all accounts he's not very good. But he speaks with such genuine interest and passion that you can't help but keep listening. He's one of the best historical narrators out there."
12859,"Agreed on this. It's been a year or two now, but I believe he hinted that his next book is going to be about Aurelian, which will likely also be great given how much you can tell Mike stans Aurelian."
12860,"Was this book good and if you have also read the frothier Lafayette history from Sarah Vowell, do these pair okay?"
12861,Wasn't that what Quills was about?
12862,Those tours sound amazing. How many people were in your group?
12863,"There are quite a few great history podcasts out there in a similar vein as history of rome. The history of persia is quite good, the history of england and the british history podcast are good, fall of civilizations for longer one offs, the hellenistic age podcast, the bulgarian history podcast, the history of china, age of conquest, the age of napoleon, the french history podcast, pontifacts.

Wow didn't realize I had so many that I listened to.  I agree the history of byzantium is pretty meh. There are some high points but on average it is well below the rest I listed. The history of ancient greece is another I think a lot of people seem to like but I was never a fan of. The history of the crusades is alright as well. Definitely a step below the rest."
12864,"Honestly, both podcasts (and just being educated about history in general) tells you a lot about how history is constantly repeating itself; in war, technological change, economic crises, and political conflict. Pretty much everything that is happening today has occurred before and the problems we are facing aren't really that new.

Sort of like that ""time is a flat circle"" bs some dude once said."
12865,Totally agree. I've learned so much from this podcast about the world.
12866,Same here. I'm still in the 40's and it's a bit of a grind.
12867,Such a plebeian statement
12868,Really?
12869,"It's about different revolutions beginning with the English Civil War.  He covers the American, French, Haitian, Spanish-American revolutions plus the Revolution of 1848, the July Revolution (France), the Paris Commune and then the Mexican and Russian Revolutions."
12870,"It think it's fair for podcasters to try and monetize their work, but yeah, he does keep adding more and more to it.

When he first started ad reads in The History of Rome, they were always a minute. Now their like 2-3 minutes alone. And always the same shit too. Like we get it bro; Harry's razors offers a great shave and Casper cuts out the middleman and audible gives you one book free. Literally every one of your audience has heard these same ads literally a couple hundred times. 

I don't mind the book promos as much, but it does all get tiring."
12871,"I mean he uses a fairly dry and monotone voice, but it pairs perfectly with the dry wit. If you're looking for someone to use vocal inflection to let you know when to listen he's not your guy, but if you are going to listen to someone talk at you for dozens of hours I prefer content over raising your voice in emotional moments"
12872,"Yeah I'm with you.  It's not even the voice but the presentation. Each episode is bookended with a weird knock-off of ""Landslide"" and then it's basically a guy reading a freshman year text book.  It's the most bland and rote podcast I've ever heard.  The info is somewhat interesting but the presentation is flat.

Hardcore History on the other hand is perfect.  It's like a guy who knows everything about a certain subject just explaining it to you at the dining room table after Thanksgiving dinner."
12873,"To think that today we have the History of Byzantium, Germany, Italy, England, France (from Fall of the Roman Empire to the Fall of the guillotine), Reaction, etc. 

We have so many long form history podcasts to choose from that we can get picky about which ones we want to watch. Back in the day, it was just Mike Duncan and Dan Carlin."
12874,Agreed for sources - I mean there's Livy (secondary) and I thiiink that's it? I'm not a professional classicist - but he also got so much better at telling the stories in history AS stories instead of lists of events as the show went on. Maybe that's just a consequence of reading from Livy lol
12875,"I'd still recommend starting from the beginning, especially since it's never bad (or anything close to bad) and the history itself is fantastic. I would say you could start at the Punic Wars - he seems to have found his groove by then - but to understand why Rome was what it was during that you should def start at the beginning."
12876,"You should start from the beginning. You won't really notice the ongoing improvement until you're a ways in (except the new mic he gets early on). And the early episodes of HoR are fairly short, 10-15 minutes iirc"
12877,The first few episodes aren't that long so you should absolutely start from the beginning
12878,The content is there episode one and it is very listenable! It just gets much better. If the quality is an issue I recommend listening on speakers until the change comes. Addresses a lot of the issues when it's not pumped directly into your head.
12879,Aww I kinda want to here that bc I started with Revolutions
12880,"Duncan does more directly quoting of sources and recounting of firsthand accounts in Revolutions compared to History of Rome, which is quite nice. 

History of Byzantium really does an amazing job of highlighting the various sources as they come and go and their contemporary biases, which I quite like."
12881,"It's really good. In some ways I think I prefer it to HoR.  The host stops at the end of each century and does a Q&A episode which really helps add some of the color and character to the eras.  

He's done around 200 episodes and just completed the 1204 sack of Constantinople, so we're in the endgame now."
12882,Yeah I think even Mike points out how he didn't do the best on HoR. Revolutions is peak history media though.
12883,"Keep in mind that one started in 2007, and that podcasting was in its infancy at the time."
12884,"Are you already subscribed? I was, and it did not show up for that reason."
12885,thank you so much.Do you know any free one that can be found on YouTube?
12886,Damn that sucks :(
12887,thanks
12888,"I also jumped around a lot. Went South American, Mexican, American, English, French, Hatian. Not sure where I'm going to go next probably 1848 Revolutions"
12889,I absolutely loved the South American season
12890,"Hmm...not sure exactly what it is...I've just found it hard to focus on, hard to stay ""in the history'. Maybe I'm just not as interested in the Roman/Revolutions history as I would like to be. Or maybe I haven't found the ""hook"" that intrigues me enough to keep me gripped to the learning!"
12891,"Yea honestly Dan Carlin is way more ""Reddit"" than Mike. I've only listened to Revolutions though"
12892,Reddit loves history podcasts much more than the average person

He has ruined plenty episodes of Lions Led By Donkeys, but he hasn't been on recently so I'm hoping Joe has woken up to this.

12967,"Lol you clearly don't get how the podcast works. It's not fake reactions. 4 hosts, 4 facts, only 3 people research each fact. So each fact has 3 hosts who have read up on it and found tangential facts and stories somewhat related to the subject. 1 host is hearing the fact for the first time. That way there's plenty to talk about and research done but they still have one blind reaction to make for good reactions, questions and discussion. So no, they aren't faking. You just didn't know that each fact gets 3 designated researchers and 1 designated reactor who doesn't know what's coming."

12979,For real. I was like 20 and a random guy started chatting me up in a supermarket about rich dad poor dad. Couldn't get away before he handed me his mlm business card. I will never read it just based on that interaction
12980,The book's thesis is about using data instead of intuition but then makes a tonne of intuitive leaps based on flimsy data. Mostly it's just conflating correlation with causation incorrectly.
12981,"Haven't listened to that podcast, but I recall the chapter talking about baby names influencing the outcomes of those kids being pretty much incorrect or unprovable. Been a follower for a long time and Freakanomics is what piqued my interest in economics. It comes across as being very insightful when quite a bit is just framed to feel insightful.

So while it does have incorrect and cherry picked data for a few of the chapters, it's still worth a read as a primer to get your mind out of the traditional mathematical modeling box of classical economics and start realizing the more Thaler/behavior economics field is fascinating as the intersection of psychology and decision making."
12982,"It's economics flavored entertainment with a lot of liberties taken with its conclusions.  There's nothing wrong with it, per se, it's primary focus is behing entertaining."
12983,[removed]
12984,Cherry picked data and straight up ignoring data when it didn't suit the authors
12985,"impossible to say. if only someone dedicated a bunch of time researching, and then explaining it clearly in an entertaining way."
12986,Their criticisms of the book were very weak. I don't think they made any good points
12987,It's just data dredging
12988,Bad research.
12989,Yep. There is so much I've fallen for over the past 10 years or so. Probably a lot of it was influenced by social media. I look back sometimes and can't believe how foolish and gullible I was. You live and learn.
12990,"I had read just part of outliers and listened to the episode, apparently I stopped right before the weirdly race focused parts luckily."
12991,Essentially the book is guilty of what it purported to expose; bad research based on inference rather than facts.
12992,"I did too... I listened to the whole thing, wish I quit out when you did.  They had a few good points, but it wasn't a good podcast, so many assumptions, bad jokes, dwelling on small details, do not recommend."
12993,Did you give superfreakconomic a read?
12994,Definitely
12995,Some of the episodes are pretty good and talk about interesting econ research.
12996,"If I can't talk for an hour about everything wrong with your book, you probably didn't say anything interesting. 

Freakonomics is an intro to the approach which behavioral economists use to investigate society. Don't get hung up on the specific conclusions from the book, as that misses the point."
12997,"Listened to most of the freaknomics podcast episodes, they're pretty in depth and it's mostly researchers and people in industry talking about their research and industries, I'm immediately suspicious of a podcast calling out freaknomics and the numerous PHDs that run through that show as being any form of problem."
12998,"If you like maintenance phase, check out You're Wrong about. Start with older episodes to get some with Michael and Sarah. Aubrey gets on it a few times, too."
12999,YES! I love Maintenance Phase and feel the same way reading through Reddit..
13000,"The worst part is it's hard to even talk about because you know, regardless of the science, you'll be shouted down hard."
13001,"Same!! So much misinformation, half-truths and wow - the fat shaming and ableism."
13002,Agreed. You see that 95% can be filed under r/confidentlyincorrect.
13003,"Based on the episodes I've listened to, I'd take their info with a large pinch of salt. There's some truth to HAES talking points, but also a lot of information that's far outside the scientific consensus."
13004,"My problem with the fat acceptance movement is it is totally treatable, and does have incredibly poor health outcomes. Saying weight and health are not correlated is total BS, how many obese 70 year old's are running around and functioning well physically. A lot of the top causes of death are obesity related. There are societal conditions that make it difficult to lose weight and that's where I empathize, because its not easy for most people to make health conscious choices. Work hours, geography and the food we consume being very high in empty calories is tough to manage."
13005,"You listened to a pseudoscience podcast and now you look down on people who (even if only incidentally) have a more accurate conception than you do.

Edit: Your hatred feeds me."
13006,"5-4 is SO good. I learned a LOT about the depths of how awful the heritage foundation is (and republicans are on college campuses).

Edit: heritage foundation and federalist society."
13007,"I love this one, Michael Hobbes FTW!"
13008,I always recommend YWA to people by directing them to the McDonalds coffee case. That episode fucked me up.
13009,"I really like Sarah and there are some great episodes once you get used to the format without Michael. 

The one that struck me most recently was the one on Chris McCandless/Into the Wild."
13010,"I struggle with Sarah because, to me, she definitely expresses radical empathy. I don't vibe with it, which is why I keep listening. It's challenging, but in a good way, if that makes sense."
13011,"Oof, this exactly. I still enjoy listening to them as they're very engaging and have wonderful chemistry together, but I can't in good conscience consider them a trusted source of information. They share a trauma about fatness that deeply undercuts their ability to be objective in any capacity and end up at trying to do anything is futile and unsustainable, and no doctor anywhere knows anything. I think they're a great starting point if you want to hear ""the other side"" before researching it and running any conclusions by a doctor"
13012,"I really stopped enjoying that podcast when they stepped into a topic about which I am actually well informed, and I realized that their stances are all extremely biased by Aubrey being a major fat acceptance advocate. Which is fine and all, but if you're going to do a podcast where you purport to scientifically scrutinize ""popular"" health knowledge, I think you're kind of obligated to try to interrogate your own biases in your conclusions."
13013,"Agreed. I started out really enjoying the podcast a year ago, but the more I listened, the more it became obvious that the hosts don't have any scientific background and are armchair experts at best. They spend the whole show egging each other on about how society is wrong and they are right and couldn't possibly be questioned."
13014,"Whoa! Thank you for the summary, I'm glad I don't have to go check out that podcast now. Dangerous pseudo scientific misinformation is my least favorite kind of podcast. They're going to get a lot of overweight people killed simply by taking away their agency...."
13015,">In the USA in any given year, Obesity kills 300,000-400,000 people.

It does not. One episode explicitly looks into this. The number you cite is from a study that was _very_ quickly challenged. It has fundamental methodological problems that severely exaggerate the problem.

>If an antivax podcast spouted pseudoscientific nonsense about the coronavirus the way Maintenance Phase spouts cherry-picked disinfo about obesity and spins conspiracy theories about how the entire medical establishment has been captured by ""fat-phobia"", we would (rightly) howl for them to be demonetized on every platform.

One reason this is a disingenuous comparison is because fatness is not contagious.

> the hosts don't believe in the first law of thermodynamics

This is also addressed (might have been the same episode as the one I mentioned above, but I don't think so). The human body is complex and strives for homeostasis. The food you eat is part of the _thermodynamics_, sure, but so are many other factors: your body's resting temperature, heart rate, activity level (NEPA/NEAT), hormones writ large, etc. Reduce the amount you eat, and other things can and do change in response, such as your NEPA level going down."
13016,I can't handle the constant loud cackling laugh
13017,Should be required listening if you think it's healthy to be obese
13018,Love maintenance phase.
13019,"I read it before I knew about Robert kiyosaki when I was about 18/19. I remember thinking that the mindset aspect of it was interesting, but there really is not a single concrete piece of advice in there about how to actually make or invest your money. He often talks about the fact that he got into business, but is very vague about what that business is, how he did it, etc. That's how I'd sum up the book - vague. 

When I found out about who Robert kiyosaki is later on, I was not surprised at all. the book feels like a cash grab."
13020,"Years ago my then boss recommended it to me.  I read it.

The people that like it are the people that will buy into MLMs, become slumlords of shitty duplexes, etc.

It's basically telling you that if you're poor it's your fault, and the way you get rich is to make questionably legal and generally amoral decisions.  

For instance, it said (roughly) that if you incorporate as a business and have an executive leadership retreat somewhere like Hawaii, while you're actually taking a week long vacation with your family, spend one hour meeting about your business, you can then deduct the entire cost of the trip as a business expense.  I'm no lawyer or accountant but that sounds like fraud that you're just hoping the IRS doesn't audit you on.

Also the real way to get rich is to buy the guy's expensive seminars.  And keep buying them.  And keeeep buying them."
13021,"I have a strong suspicion that all self-help material is commercial success built on shaky foundations.

I have an example that I'm not going to name here because of it's rabid fan base, and I don't need Doxxing today."
13022,"> it's absolute shit that peddles crappy advice to just sell books and not actually help.

That was my take on it."
13023,"As someone who actually really liked the book, the first book does actually have some good information. No, it does not tell you how to actually do anything, but rather it does explain how money works. I feel that his definitions for terms such as income, expense, asset, liability, cash flow, and wealth are very clear and helpful in making financial decisions. His categorization of the cash flow quadrants does a decent job of the nature of wealth. Will reading the book make you rich? No. But if you do something like start up your own business, I believe the concepts will be helpful in decision making."
13024,The same!
13025,Yup!
13026,"Yeah but given how many people have bought that book and consumed the snake oil, it has an air of legitimacy that is clearly unearned and needed discussion."
13027,"She is brilliant! And yes, great episode"
13028,"""Just be a successful entrepreneur, quit working paycheck to paycheck!"" - Every asshole either born on 3rd base, ripping people off for a living, or both"
13029,And yet as someone with a statistical background they weren't exactly wrong considering the book doesn't hold up to modern statistical standards so I don't exactly know what got your goad other than a smug idea that you know more about statistics?
13030,"Why is Freakonomics a bad book? I haven't read it but I listen to the podcast and it's pretty legit and they reference the book regularly. They are academics and the book just describes some of their research, some of which has held up some of which hasn't (that's research though). What are your/the podcasts main critisicms?"
13031,"Yeah I want to keep listening to their show but I realized that their reporting has a lot of the same holes and errors as the books they are covering in the ""The Coddling of the American Mind"" episode, about 45 minutes in when they talk about Evergreen State College and Michael essentially agrees with the book that silly majors are stupid because he knew a person that majored in ""Outdoor Recreation"". Which is essentially what I just got my Master's in. It's an important field, covering things like Attention Restoration Theory (your brain works better if you go into nature regularly), what avalanche training strategies work, and how to handle access to parks. Obviously this was just a one off joke but agreeing with the book they are criticizing made me reasses how I thought about their reporting."
13032,">their rebuttal was just a lot of smirky smugness and saying things don't hold up by ""modern statistical methods"".

Thanks for saving me a listen. Considering the past few hundred episodes of freaknomics being mostly PHDs and various professionals working in various industries talking about their research and industries, I'm just waaaay more skeptical about a podcast that feels the need to take down freaknomics than freaknomics itself.

As soon as I read that I thought ""this is most likely some smug assholes who don't actually have any backing in the fields to actually criticize freaknomics."""
13033,"Aaaaah, thank you. I have really enjoyed Michael and Aubrey together on Maintenance Phase, but I really do miss Sarah and her precision. She kept Michael grounded. He spins off into hyperbole and he gets less factual and I find myself cringing at some of the things that come out of his mouth that he spirals about that are either common knowledge or Googleable. He leans into the smug, eyeroll-y, know-it-all stance too hard lately and it's making me not a fan anymore."
13034,">Your Wrong About

Is this a joke"
13035,You didn't learn how to spell You're.
13036,"Not at all. These are genuinely terrible books that injected some awful ideology into America. 

Love seeing books like Freakinomics and Rich Dad Poor Dad get ripped to shreds"
13037,"Edit:This is a response to u/goingtoperusoonish after they said they felt like the only people who don't like the podcast are conservatives.

The thing is, I am far left and I did overall agree with their assessment that Freakonomics and Outliers are terrible books. But they didn't always have the most well-thought out criticisms. There were a lot of times where they would say ""we just know that isn't true"" without providing anything beyond that. It was a lot of the pot calling the kettle black. That combined with their airs of superior intellect does make them a bit insufferable.

You can agree with someone's stance on something, but cringe when you hear them provide their reasoning for their stance."

13039,"Okay, so. I was like 20 and casually dating around, and this guy I knew gave me a copy of The Game under the pretense of showing me what guys were doing so I could avoid it I guess? I read the book, thought it was pretty well done, put it on my shelf, whatever. Neil Strauss comes to town to do a book signing for whatever his latest thing was at the time, I went out to it to get my copy of The Game signed because why not. While he signed my book, Neil asked me to join him for drinks after the signing. I was legitimately excited, I wasn't really supposed to be in bars and here's this hotshot author asking me out. Except it wasn't him asking me to drinks, he invited a group of folks. Mostly women, with like two guys thrown in who were definitely not any sort of physical or romantic competition. We were hanging out and I just was not feeling it. Being the anxious creature that I am, I just sort of sat there for another hour trying to plan my escape. At one point, he put his hand on my knee, leaned in, and asked me what I was thinking about. 
... It took everything in me not to laugh in his face and tell him that I was thinking that the reason I was there was because he signed my copy of the book where he outlined exactly the method he was using on me. Instead I made some excuses to not go back to his hotel room with two other girls and have forever chuckled at my naivety for believing that last 1/4 of the book where he's all Mr Reformed.

Edit to add I absolutely have a picture of 20 year old gangly awkward me standing next to him and he had us pose like I was swearing on The Game as if it's a Bible (which the cover design is very much meant to look like)."

13044,What's wrong with freakanomics
13045,How come?
13046,"I really wanted to like the show, it was recommended by a really good podcaster, but they had really bad takes only based on their experiences."
13047,"I got a good chuckle the first time he introduced himself with a large pause between Jack and Ery Cider in the intro.

You're not fooling anyone with that pause Jackery!"

Hey /u/jackrhysider this dude wants to know how you spell your name"

13059,For a long time I thought it was Jack Reciter
13060,Absolutely! I submit his podcast as CPEs and haven't been rejected yet! Lol
13061,His actual name is Jack Rhysider
13062,"Yes.

What you're not getting in this podcast is the day to day of a security person but his coverage of events and techniques is right on along with his clear explanations of what's happening."

13067,The Xbox underground episodes are which started me on this podcast
13068,"Black duck eggs, man. That one's good too."
13069,Loteria is another favorite of mine
13070,Surprised it's not a Netflix series yet. Was wild.
13071,I'm almost caught up to current  so sometimes at work I'll re listen those episodes.
13072,Gonna check 'em out. I really liked the GOllumfuns. Brett Johnson is so damn charismatic and his stories were endlessly intriguing.
13073,"Yes. Holy shit that two part series was extremely interesting to follow. What a life.

I really enjoyed 102 (Money Maker) as well. The level of detail the guy put into making counterfeit money was astounding."
13074,The ending to that one hit like a truck.
13075,"Pretty sure that one made everyone who had any understanding of Pen testing (even just by listening to a few Darknet Diaries) angry. 

At least it hit the news and got some major attention and ire from the whole community. If I were those guys, I'd definitely have a newspaper clipping of that story somewhere in their wallet for whenever it may be applicable. 

The sheriff coming to talk to everyone to claim not to be the bad guy still missed the entire point of the test. ""If they had just told us they were going to break into the courthouse that night, it would have been perfectly fine. Can't have my deputies driving like maniacs to get there for some test thing I still don't understand all too well."""

You'll need GRTiQ podcast for technical aspects of web3."
13082,It's not a knock on him because his content is absolutely fantastic
13083,Some of the stories are wild! Love the drug dealer one or the guy that robbed the wrong bank
13084,sounds intriguing. What do you mean pen testers? My mind jumps to my handy dandy non contact voltage pen tester I keep with me in my every day work tool pouch as I work on electrical stuff frequently.
13085,I found it more uncomfortable due to the fact that it felt less threatening before we faced a pandemic that has taken millions of lives worldwide. Listening to it develop in real time on their podcast was very interesting and insightful but it got a little too real for recreational listening.
13086,"Oh god it's even better than that. Thank heavens they put transcripts of the podcasts on their site!

>Erin Allmann Updyke (laughs)

>Erin Allmann Updyke Yeah no. Not without his knowledge."
13087," As a history buff, I absolutely fucking LOVE Dan Carlin.

Wrath of the Khans and King of Kings are also phenomenal.

Prophets of Doom is also just fantastic."
13088,Hard agree. I've relistened to it multiple times and have probably ruined several friendships by screaming about Verdun or Passchendaele in dinner party settings. Dan's Magnum Opus for sure.
13089,"Several years back, I was flying home from Barcelona to the U.S. I had previously downloaded the 'Blue for Armageddon' specifically for my flights. On the way back home it just so happened that he got to the part about the war in France as I was flying over it. I was looking out the window the whole time and just imagining the things he was describing happening below me. It enhanced and solidified my love for his podcasts! I recommend his podcasts to everyone that has a mild interest in history/current events."
13090,"I thought the same thing, but after initially bouncing off Supernova In The East I am now just as hooked as I am on Blueprint For Armageddon. Dan has one hell of a legacy."
13091,"The ghengis khan one blows that one out of the water in my opinion, and that was a huge hurdle to clear"
13092,I came into this thread to rave about exactly these episodes. Am not that surprised it's not needed anymore. Just cancel your plans for coming week and listen to this. End quote.
13093,Supernova in the east is even greater in my opinion
13094,"Any idea what it's called or what episode?  I see 14 episodes total...6 are ""supernova in the east"" which are WW2.  3 are 'king of kings"" which is way before that.  None of the episode descriptions I'm seeing mention WWI"
13095,"Wow I have actually said this very thing to some people before, I thought I was just particularly taken with the series. It is cool to hear it resonated with some other people in a similar way."
13096,Which one is that? Just had a look through Apple Podcasts (my preferred choice but will look elsewhere if needed) and can't find one that is obviously that episode...
13097,The WWI mud story stays with you.
13098,"Wrath of the Khans is a masterpiece as well.

Though one point of interest, this is more a series of audio documentaries that just so happen to get published on podcast sites."
13099,"Blueprint for Armageddon is amazing. Supernova in the East is also fascinating.

I enjoy Carlin's other work, but not nearly as much as those two."
13100,Is my only option to listen thru Apple Music?
13101,"Absolutely. Supernova In The East on the rise and fall of The Empire Of Japan is incredible, too. He delves more into societal, economic, and internal political factors in that series but it sheds such a clear understanding of why The Empire Of Japan made the decisions it made.

Edit: Ghosts Of The Ostfront series on Nazi invasion of Russia is also amazing. The series on The Celtic Holocaust about Julius Caesar in Europe, too. Honestly, Dan has close to 100 hours of absolutely incredibly well done, informative, and truly ""must hear"" podcasts. Also, recommend looking into his shorter series in Hardcore History: Addendum where he has short hour or two long episodes on stuff like Imperial German Army vs 3rd Reich."
13102,You should consider watching the WW1 in real time on YouTube then. They went through the entire war in real time (weekly summary episodes plus specials) 100 years on. It ran from 2014 to 2019 and it's probably the single greatest complete historical record that is freely available. The same people are doing the same thing for ww2 and it's up to 1944 and it's really quite outstanding.
13103,I'm taking a look on Spotify and I can't exactly discern the content by the title. Any chance you could direct me to the right episode?
13104,What makes it so good?
13105,"Blueprint is absolutely fantastic and one of the best series I've listened to. That said his one-off ""The Destroyer of Worlds"" is a fantastic listen to me and I really love Prophets of Doom. That's probably my favorite single episode one. It's just such a wild story"
13106,Wrath of the Kahns is up there as well.
13107,I was wondering why you wrote HH for a moment
13108,Do you know the title of that episode? I'm looking now but can't find the one that describes the WWI period
13109,"But can you say ""the World War One one, won"" five times, fast?"
13110,Is this Dan Carlin? I'm probably dumb but which one is the WW1 episode? I can only see Supernova in the East and some older history ones.
13111,"I agree, but to me the episodes about Rome are almost equal, maybe 99% just as good as Blueprint.

Mainly Death Throes of the Republic, but that itself becomes so much better with the knowledge of Punic nightmares in advance and the Celtic Holocaust is also multiplying the joy of a relisten.

I do think Blueprint has more relisten value though somehow. 
I don't think there will ever be a movie nearly half as good as that podcast."
13112,I thought Blueprint to Armageddon was the WW1 one
13113,Do you know what the series is called? I'm searching for it in there directory but it's not coming up
13114,Literally just wrapped that one up 2 days ago.  Very much answered the question of why Hitler's brinksmanship let him get as far as he did.  No *sane* person wanted to start another war.
13115,It is the Mongol Empire one for me.
13116,That and Supernova in the East about WWII in the Pacific.
13117,As an American who went through public school and college with a cursory knowledge of the first world war Blueprint for Armageddon got me so wrapped up in WW1 history that I actually went to Verdun on 11/11/18 for the 100th anniversary of the end of the War. Such a cool experience.
13118,"Do you know how to get it on iPhone? I'm only seeing access to 25 episodes on the podcast app, and don't see WWI. I love learning about the war especially from people who make it interesting"
13119,Where can I find this? There's only about 4 episodes on Apple and I can't find ww1
13120,Such a pointless shame people on reddit that didn't listen to it managed to get it cancelled. It's no longer on Spotify because someone was offended without listening to it
13121,"What I always remembered, being in high school in the late 90s, is that they taught like 1900-present in the last chapter of the history book and it was always like the last week of school and we never paid attention."
13122,I remember it being taught as it was trench warfare and set the table for WWII. That was about it.
13123,"I've read whole books about it and it's a difficult war to summarize or give a clear mental picture of. Especially when taught from the US history perspective. The US entered it quite late, and the causes of it are based in generations of European politics. The war was a stalemate for a very long time, and the notable battles (notable for sickening loss of human life with no clear result for either side) all seem to have a similar shape. 

There were political cartoons that depicted the armies fighting on and on until the 1980s. That's how bad the sense of stalemate and grim tedium was."
13124,"Yeah, same here.  We talked about WWI, but it was very limited.  I guess it kind of makes sense, the US's involvement in WWI was much less than in WWII.

Then again I felt like the same thing was true when it came to discussing the war in the Pacific during WWII.  We hardly covered that in school at all either."
13125,The fallout of WW1 was a huge part of WW2 in our history books.
13126,"The US was only involved for 1.5 years, and besides volunteers only officially fighting for less than a year. Plus it doesn't have the clear villainy side of WWII, just a bunch of assholes doing stupid shit on all sides."
13127,It's because we really didn't do much in it. American history curriculum writers hate that.
13128,I think people are expecting too much of what a school class can cover.  You won't learn everything you should know about history in school. At some point it's about your own curiosity and self-directed learning across the rest of your life.
13129,"The US didn't really get involved except as a supplier in the war until the very late stages, and we certainly don't have the generational scars from WW1 that they do in Europe. I think that's why, it most figures into the history of the US as a precoursor to WWII"
13130,"We were only in it for 1 year.  And it didn't take place on our soil, a la the Civil War, so hard to go visit the sites where it happened."
13131,"My school experience learning about WWI: ""Some Ferdinand guy got shot, then Tony goes over the top, NOW ON TO WORLD WAR II..."""
13132,"Revolution started the country, Civil War nearly ended it and WWII was recent enough that everyone knew someone involved in it. Vietnam was talked about, but there was still some uncomfortable feelings about it. Very little about the War of 1812, Mexican American War, Spanish American War, WWI and Korea. And the American Indian Wars were whittled down to sounding like just a few battles instead of lasting over 300 years"
13133,"The Revolutionary War, the Civil War, and WWII were emphasized in history due to how they describe America's character and morality. At least in my generation, these conflicts were taught as propaganda to teach children about my country's ""rightful"" place in the world. WWI lacks a tidy message like that to spoonfed American children so it's easier to blow by it than try to make sense of it."
13134,"We learned a ton about it, but the test questions were really basic if that makes sense. 

I had a really good history teacher my senior year and he seemed to give a lot more details than necessary - often showing videos and reading first hand sources. 

Teaches play a huge role in education honestly and it's a shame they're so under appreciated - I can remember every teacher who had an impact on me, whether good or bad."
13135,">	Revolutionary war, Civil war, Reconstruction... oh crap it's already March... World war II."
13136,"Nah, I learned about the key plot points of American involvement: neutrality, Lusitania, Zimmerman telegram, ""safe for democracy"", intervention, Woodrow Wilson and the League of Nations, Treaty of Versailles.

But it certainly didn't get the kind of coverage of other wars, probably because a lot of history classes like to focus on battles, US history focuses on US involvement; there wasn't a huge window for the former, nor were we ever really the main characters to address the latter.

And yeah, it's seen as setting up WW2 which is far more significant for the US."
13137,"Maybe this is a conspiracy theory, but i feep like the american school system avoids more complex wars with no clear good guy. CW, WW2, and the revolution all have easily identifiabke bad guys whereas WW1 doesnt. Same deal with Vietnam (you could make the argument that the US was the bad guy in that war)"
13138,"To be fair the US was hardly involved. They just came in at the end. I'm not suggesting that wasn't helpful or there wasn't aid provided prior, but it was mostly France and Great Britain vs Germany."
13139,"I moved around a lot as a kid (mostly in Europe) and every new school I went to, they were beginning to study WWI. I was a 14-year-old expert - quoting Wilfred Owen, reciting Somme casualty figures. Never did study the US civil or revolutionary wars, but the Great War is burned into me. 
(I love Dan Carlin but I never listened  to the World War I episodes because I figured he would stress the gruesome parts of the trenches. Am I making a terrible mistake?)"
13140,"So fucking true. But even though my classes went over WWII, they completely glossed over the evils of Stalin's Soviet Union, the viciousness of the Japanese Imperialists, and the rise of Fascism in Mussolini's Italy. They made it seem like the only evil enemy were the German Nazis, *completely* oversimplifying the sheer complexity of the global landscape during WWII."
13141,"Seems like the USA mostly ignores WW2 as well, since they somehow believed they were the sole reason The Allies won"
13142,"It's too complicated. It's the finale of the age of empires in Europe, and they definitely don't cover that in school"
13143,"I just watched All Quiet on the Western Front and remember thinking to myself ""was the US in this war? I think we were but I'm not entirely sure"" and then a few minutes later one of the characters mentions US troops being sent to Europe.

All I remember of WWI from history class is stuff about Franz Ferdinand"
13144,You just don't have enough time to cover everything and compared to the others WW1 was just not as impactful for the US as the other wars you mentioned.
13145,It was only ever talked about in the context that it set the stage for WWII for me.
13146,"You don't remember the buzzwords ""powder keg of Europe"" getting passed around by teachers talking about Archduke Ferdinand's assassination?"
13147,"I swear I remember learning about the War of 1812 as well.

But I feel like unless the US had a big presence in the war, you weren't learning much about it, if at all. And the US _did not_ have a big presence in World War 1. Despite the name, it was a very Europe-focused war. They showed up near the end after fighting had almost ended, a lot of troops never even saw combat. Basically, the presence of American troops changed nothing about the course of the war. That's probably why it doesn't get mentioned much in US schools, because 95% of what they're talking about doesn't involve the US.

It's weird, I didn't even know something like The Battle of Hastings existed until college, when I took a medieval history course and that's one of the most important battles in human history (right up there with Marathon) that shaped Western Society. You'd think they'd at least mention it, you know? US schools are _really_ biased towards things the US was involved in. I remember learning about Greece and Rome, but I think we spent less time on both of those combined than we did on the Revolution, for instance."
13148,"As a Canadian, it's definitely the war I learned the most about in school. Learned very little about the US civil war/revolutionary war though."
13149,"Going to a Texas public school, I really mostly remember taking Texas History like 3 times throughout my schooling career."
13150,It's because you were likely taking US History through most of your education. I remember World History being an elective that you could only take in high school.
13151,Add the Korean War to the list of skipped over wars
13152,"I remember trying to buy WWI books/resources for the public library, as we had a ton of sources already on the Civil War and WWII. I was shocked at the limited number of scholarly/encyclopedia-type books available on WWI."
13153,"No, here in TN the only thing we talked about was Alvin C. York because he's a Tennessean"
13154,"We learned about WWI, but it was like a TV series ""filler episode"". Just something minor, a single chapter, and maybe it was a single day of learning with very little detail. So, we knew it happened, we knew the very basics (even then, a lot was left out), and we moved on. Probably on par with the Spanish-American War or the Korean War. It was a huge deal, but almost like the forgotten war. 

I love history, so it was something I enjoyed reading about later. However, even then I'm still constantly learning new fascinating things about it. No matter how much you read, podcasts you listen to, documentaries you watch, there's always something new. And sometimes, it's not some niche buried knowledge, it's something larger that you should have picked up on before. I love that. 

But, yea - they pretty much skipped over WW1 where I was. WW2 they went into a bit more detail. Saw some gruesome pictures of things that probably wouldn't be allowed in school these days. Brutal."
13155,"I definitely feel that! It was like they barely mentioned it. And it's my ""favorite""(??) war. I'm not sure why, I'm just extra fascinated by it."
13156,"Not only the US, in the Netherlands it's the same.
We learn almost everything there is to know about ww2, but we know fuck all about ww1. Which is very weird to me."
13157,"Yeah we didn't learn much about it in my school either. After college I wanted to learn more, so I read a non-fiction history book called ""The Guns of August"" by Barbara Tuchman which was hugely informative. It focuses on the very beginning of the war (August 1914) but there's so much to it.  
  
Very readable and because of its tight focus, it's not too long."
13158,"Honestly there isn't even a simple way to explain ww1 that does it justice. Yeah you can be told that arch Duke Ferdinand being shot ignited a powder keg, but does that give you context to the relationship between France England Austro-Hungary and newly formed Germany and Russia? Hell throughout all my year in public education and honors classes no one ever mentioned Prussia"
13159,"In the US, as well. I learned about it in advanced World History in high school, but only for a brief 4-6 week segment. The most that I actually learned about WWI was in college, and that was actually in a literature class."
13160,"That's always interesting from a foreign perspective. I presume it's downplayed in the US because there are other topics to teach, and the country was on the battlefield for less than a year. America's involvement was actually very important to both national and global history, but still.

In Canada, where I'm from, WWI is an unavoidable topic, since we were in the conflict the full four years as a Commonwealth country. When I was growing up I remember Remembrance Day (Nov. 11)  events being very solemn - even at school assemblies, the overarching message was ""never again."" On top of that I used to live in Ottawa, the capital, which has both the National War Memorial and a Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. It's the centerpiece of federal Remembrance Day ceremonies."
13161,"Supernova in the East is excellent, as is Ghosts of the Ostfront,

BUT if you want an episode that will show you a side of American history you almost certainly missed in school

The American Peril 

is a great listen."
13162,"It was a four year long war, and we were in it for like 20 odd months. Certainly our involvement had an impact, but I think the American troops were spared a lot of the real horrors. As an example, the British suffered something like 19,000 deaths the first day of the Somme and that shit went on for months to literally move the front lines 6 miles. Our soldiers just didn't experience that, and by extension the people at home didn't experience things like all the men in their village being killed also."
13163,"It's been a while, but that is my recollection as well. WWI was basically just taught as the preamble to WWII.

I went and looked at the [AP US History] (https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-united-states-history) course overview and it kind of makes sense, Unit 7 is from 1890-1945 which means you're starting at the end of reconstruction during a period where the US is still rapidly adding states -> Spanish American War -> WWI -> Great Depression -> WWII

That's even skipping things like first flight, prohibition, the interstate system, women's suffrage, and 4 other amendments. 

That's arguably the most influential period in American History and its 10-17% of the AP US History curriculum"
13164,"Including what some of the other answers of the US joining late and not much being learned from it as a nation, I think a lot of it is when we finally got involved, it was not a lot and our soldiers were mostly under the command of the British and French, so there were not many true American victories to write and brag about. 

Not only that, but the fall out of Wilson's Fourteen Points about how to treat the Central Powers and create the League of Nations, which USA was not a member of."
13165,That and the Flu of 1918. I think they run out of time and rush to hit WW2.
13166,"You are absolutely right. I think it is a direct function of the fact that the US was not involved in WWI until the end, and we suffered a very small amount of casualties compared to countries like France and Germany. That is no excuse for inadequately teaching it, but it's the only reason I can think of."
13167,"Well, the US wasn't really there for much of it lol we get a big thing on it in Canada since it was the first time Canada as a country really distinguished itself on the world stage."
13168,"It definitely got less time than other wars in my history class (graduated in 2001), but we definitely touched on several bits of it.  Probably just due to lack of American involvement for most of the war, compared to say WW2 where we were heavily involved in materiel and manufacturing even before we entered the war proper."
13169,"Yeah kind of.. We did watch ""All's Quiet on the Western Front"" a few times.  But probably just on sub days."
13170,Lot of the worlds' problems then and now stem from capitalism. Ever wonder why we don't hear more about the 30s and labor unrest and the new deal and skip right to Pearl Harbor and the gijoe nonsense?
13171,Yup. I knew nothing about WWI. Still don't know much.
13172,"LMAO here in the south i was taught the revolution like 15 times, the civil war once (literally taught us that the south did nothing wrong and were fighting for freedom i am not kidding) and that was it. that was war."
13173,"Honestly I feel like reconstruction is the most overly focused piece of US history. There's a few important things that happen, but my history classes always covered it over the course of two weeks when I felt it might've been a 2-day topic at most"
13174,"Ghosts of the ostfront is amazing. I think Armageddon, ghosts, and supernova in the east are my favorites."
13175,Blueprint for Armageddon
13176,"Where are you listening to it? I can't find it on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, overcast, or audible. Where the heck is it??"
13177,"Agreed, supernova in the east is amazing. Definitely up there with my favorites, ghosts of the ostfront and blueprints to Armageddon."
13178,Is this one on the podcast app? I've been looking and don't see one labelled WW1 but I'm positive it's a user issue. Maybe it's on YouTube?
13179,Ken Burns did WWI??
13180,Blueprint for Armageddon
13181,Do you know a good source for accurate information on this?
13182,"He took the whole sandwich thing out which I always took as tongue in cheek anyway, like Gavirilo was just chilling around thinking the plot failed and out pops the Duke's car, not that he was literally eating a sandwich. Every single thread with Dan mentioned someone brings this up and I really think people blow it out of proportion. He's a perfectly acceptable pop history podcaster and he (mostly) gets his facts right. I read a lot of history books and even actual real life historians get things wrong from time to time. It's not really a big deal. I feel like people bring this up just because they want to sound smart. He's really excellent at getting people interested in history, which is the most important thing."
13183,"You haven't specified much, and I haven't listened to the podcast myself, but I'm going to take a wild guess and ask if the podcast perpetuates the myth that Princip finally got a perfect opportunity to assassinate Ferdinand due to going to grab a sandwich? 

Not a major inaccuracy in the grand scheme of things, but it is an example of how pop history and rumors sometimes distort historical facts."
13184,"The colonial world order might well have broken just from long felt impacts of WW1, but it was definitively after WW2 that it fell apart completely. That's part of why it draws so much focus.


That *might* be for the best... but what a heavy price to pay."
13185,"That museum is outstanding. I visited it not long after listening to the series and it was easily one of the best museum visits I've ever had. I rate it higher than the WW2 museum in New Orleans.

KC in general is a really fun city to visit"
13186,"They're behind a paywall now. As he releases new episodes older ones get pushed out if the free zone.

You can buy them on iTunes or on his site. It's like 15 bucks for the whole set, and it's well worth it.

13187,*ageen and ageen and ageeeeeeennnnn
13188,"""End quote."""
13189,Listened to the entire Ghengis Khan podcast on a long road trip with friends.  What an excellent piece of media it was.
13190,"Last year at the initial stages of war in Ukraine there was this event, very DanCarlin-esque: an airbase called Chernobayevka was within the range of ukrainian artillery but the russians seem to have gotten instructions to establish a functioning base there, so they kept building it only to be pulverized by ukrainians. It happend like 15 times if I'm not mistaken. I couldn't help but to imagine Dan narrating it some tome down the road with ""agaaaayynn and agaaayyynnn and agayyynnn"" hahaha"
13191,"The way he finds a thesis and recurring idea for each ""book"" is really interesting, and I think the idea of ""who will be the first historian to write about the upside of hitler?"" In that series really made me reconsider conquerors and great leaders from history."
13192,"Until they (the Mongols)  attacked Japan and ""The Divine Wind."""
13193,Time for another listen!
13194,"And then Genghis was like ""Hey Daoist priest, is there a way I can live forever?"" 

And fortunately, in those days, there was not."
13195,"This is hysterically true, and I love it lol. I was just thinking about this today, how his inflection changes with quotes"
13196,"I know it's a good show, but this is why I just can't get into it. He says every quote in this loud obnoxious monotone where the meaning just feels completely lost because I can't get over how ridiculous it sounds."
13197,"Now, ladies and gentlemen, that's a real 'Statue-of-Liberty-in-the-sand-moment' for future civilisations, isn't it!?"
13198,"quote HIS RHINOCEROS SMELLED LIKE A POPPADOM: SWEATY, SALTY, STRANGE AND STRONG. end quote"
13199,That was an amazing story
13200,The one of that Japanese mother having to leave her two children trapped in their burning house is the single saddest thing I've ever heard. That was from Hiroshima though I believe.
13201,"Look as much as I love Dan Carlin, he isn't, as he said multiple times stated, a historian. His job as a podcaster is to bring history in an entertaining and digestible way. But sometimes it isn't, sometimes the history that has to be told is in conflict with the goal of being entertaining. 

So we shouldn't treat it as a college course. It is an amateur podcast."
13202,That's how I have described it to friends: It's basically WWI 201 in podcast form.
13203,So he only usually posts his most recent ones for free and charges about a buck per episode otherwise. Which in my opinion is well worth the money.
13204,"Blitz of Human Resources (Almost 6 hours) 

Twilight of the Aesir (just over 5 hours)"
13205,Yeah he's done one on transatlantic slavery and another one on the end of the vikings. I think very recently there was a new Hardcore History: Addendum episode but I haven't checked that one yet
13206,Hardcore history is one guy giving you straight facts for 4 or 5 hours per episode. They are what you would expect a history lecture to be like rather than a typical podcast
13207,WWe ze lluhhiiiiooooloiiii op mmmmmm nu er weer t Wu t wel ouik
13208,"Starts a series about Persian kings talking about Clint Eastwood as a Spartan


Laconic"
13209,"He wanted to do a show about Cleopatra, and ended up with the Gracchi bros and the fall of the Republic"
13210,i just started it because of this thread and he says persia multiple times in the first couple minutes lol
13211,I fuckin love the first hour of talking about cline east wood Darth Vader 300 Assyria Babylon and all that. It's so good
13212,"The ancient titles are so badass. King of Kings, king of the universe.

And then they have the historical records where some ancient Babylonian king rules for 12,000 years.

It's so damn cool"
13213,"Agreed, i always enjoy cruisng around Google Earth along with history podcasts. Having been in Iraq with the US Army, I really enjoyed learning the history of that area. I wish I had listened to it before my deployments. I could have better appreciated some of the historical sights I got to see."
13214,I did exactly that on my second listen through. I made a family tree to follow all the different kings and lineages. It was actual kinda fun.
13215,Good description. His Painfotainment episode was intense for just that reason.
13216,"My view of the Persian Empire, the ""bad guys,"" was totally changed after this series. I found myself thinking, ""Would it have been better if the Persians won?"""
13217,"It got me to read a lot more into the rise and fall of the Japanese Empire.

It is absolutely bonkers how big of a role the Sino-Japanese wars played in leading up to America's entry to the Pacific War and all the way into current day policy in that theatre. 

Japan's actions in China and Korea basically set the stage for Communism to sweep through Asia, and it didn't help Russia neither. If I recall correctly, Japan also conquered Taiwan, and China just never got it back after the war.

They didn't even mention the Sino Japanese War in HS, as if the Pacific War didn't apply to the US until Pearl Harbor happened."
13218,That story and the account of the Filipino guy who had to play dead while his family was brutally murdered in front of him really fucked with me.
13219,I found it kind of oddly paced and structured. The first two parts felt like they were going in a different direction than the latter 3. Still hits hard.
13220,"You can skip ahead to pearl harbour, but it really starts cranking when Japan starts losing. Ooo boy"
13221,Check out some of the other podcasts on this thread - also great content!
13222,If we are lucky.
13223,I listen via my Podcast app on my iPhone - all in order and ready to go - happy listening friend!
13224,"All of his stuff is on his website for a small fee. Only the last 5-6 episodes released are free on podcast apps. 

https://www.dancarlin.com"
13225,"Blueprint for Armageddon is the WW1 series. Ghosts of the Ostfront is about the eastern front of WW2. The one about the nuclear bomb is Supernova in the East. If you really dont have the money for them, they are available on the high seas if you catch my drift."
13226,"It never gets old to me. Long day at work today, so I might just listen to it again!"
13227,One of the most honestly named departments in workplaces.
13228,"It is everything I wish a history class could be.  Not a dry recitation of names, places, and events, but a gripping _story_ that just happens to cover real events.  You trade breadth for depth, true, but that is an entirely acceptable compromise."
13229,far below
13230,Absolutely worth it too.
13231,They're free on Apple Music
13232,"Would you have the same opinion of his podcasts if instead of  ""take this with a grain of salt"" he started truthfully saying ""now this is totally wrong but imagine if""? 

Doesn't that defeat the purpose of a history podcast if you're just spinning tall tales?"
13233,"I can't get past the accent. For whatever reason, I can't understand him many times. I wish it weren't so."
13234,"By ""hardline historians"" do you mean ""actual researchers""? I don't feel like I've heard any academic historian endorse him for exceptional accuracy or historiographical nuance vs. (at best) getting people excited about periods or topics that they can then go read good books about."
13235,"I've heard historians complain about him getting stuff wrong a few times, but to be fair to the guy he's usually (*usually*) pretty good at letting the audience know when he's going off-book and just wildly speculating for the fun of it."
13236,He's gotten criticism for basically glossing over German war crimes lol.
13237,"Boring? He's witty, whereas Carlin is trying to sell a show real hard."
13238,I think you misunderstood what I was trying to say. I love history and listen to a couple of history podcasts but Hardcore History feels like it tries to make history sound cool instead of just talking about it. Maybe it's his voice i don't know.
13239,"Oh Mike Duncan is definitely a bit cringe lol, and I love Mike"
13240,Absolutely agree. Thanks for the recommendation- I will check it out!
13241,He often rambles for about 30 minutes and then gets into the meat and facts. Worth skipping ahead if that's all that bothers you so far!
13242,That is exactly how I felt
13243,"His sources are often just plain bad.

There's just no possible justification for using an old discredited source no matter how much you like the story. It's silly that he makes several hours of speaking content from a book that a simple google search would tell you is wrong.

He's just telling stories."
13244,"I agree that it's hard to ask him for anything extra other then he is doing. I love his podcasts because they are engaging and I get to learn about things I probably wouldn't read otherwise.   


While he does his research he still picks sources that to him seem as correct and he is not exactly qualified to do that because as he says himself, he is not a historian. He still gets like 90% right so I think overall he is net benefit and gets more people to care abut history, just that those people should realize that his takes sometimes might not be correct.  


To answer your question here is one good post about inaccuracies https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/hqfitc/dan\_carlin\_and\_the\_rape\_of\_belgium/"
13245,Fair point
13246,Fair point.
13247,"The trouble is, look at all the people in this thread who are *absolutely* treating his word as gospel. And downvoting the one user who disagrees and calling him ""full of shit"" for saying r/AskHistorians is more academically rigorous than Carlin is.

> but he's an entertainer and not the arbiter of truth

That's Tucker Carlson's get-out clause too."
13248,"Literally my whole comment was in agreement to your last paragraph... I don't get why I'm getting downvoted. I never said ppl shouldn't watch him, i said ppl should be careful with his podcast... I guess I hurt a lot of very sensitive ppl's feelings in this thread lol. 

If y'all want to actually learn some history, the podcasts: History Hit, the History of Rome and History of England are all good. Your Welcome "
13249,"I think its more like he'll include whatever stories sound cool as absolute fact, where he should be eyeing his sources skeptically. 

For what its worth I've also heard him discuss non historical stuff on a podcast and he was blatantly telling a fake story about his personal life. Sorta ruined his credibility for me."
13250,I would rather listen then to historians if I can.
13251,"Askhistorians is the closest thing you can get on social media to peer-reviewed academic spaces. I'm so tired rn so apologies with the way I'm typing this rn, I hope it makes sense lol. But, Askhistorians is extremely thorough when it comes to only allowing high-quality answers about historical topics from actual, verified historians. It's much different from Askhistory. All the people that are allowed to answer Reddit questions are legit PhD -holding historians or PhD students from around the world."
13252,"In no way does any academic historian feel threatened by Dan Carlin. Dan wouldn't want them to, his work is NOT the same as theirs, and he spends a great deal of time talking about his ""fan of history"" approach on almost every episode. 

Look, I love me some Hardcore History. He inspired me to do what I do now. But there's a pretty huge gap between an actual PhD Historian and a guy with a microphone and a pile of books."
13253,"I was a history major too. It seems silly to me to believe that historians would feel ""threatened"" by a random guy excitedly talking about history. 

Thats a big stretch imo."
13254,"> I would say more historians feel threatened by him and his work

lmao, fucking delusional."
13255,Is the WW1 series called Blueprint for Armageddon?
13256,Old episodes are on Apple Music for free.
13257,"They have more relevance to today's politics than people realize. 

More, far more, than the history of rome for as fun as that topic is."
13258,"Revolutions is insanely good, really show how much Duncan evolved.

In the same vein, The History of Byzantium is excellent."
13259,"Same, I finished the Russian Revolution yesterday afternoon."
13260,"Hello,

And welcome to, revolutions.

Episode 11.1

The reddit comment"
13261,The Haitian Revolution (series 4.\*) is kinda my favourite
13262,Anybody who finishes the Revolutions podcast is contractually obligated to listen to the Reaction podcast by Britney Gil. Start with the Pinkertons.
13263,How is the hell on earth series? I'm refinishing the deck this weekend and just started the first free episode - thinking I might go all in on the rest this weekend.
13264,"For Revolutions, you may want to look through the different seasons and pick one that interests you most to start with.  They definitely build off of each other as the seasons go on, but it's by no means necessary to listen to them all in order.

My personal faves were the French and Russian revolutions, and the season covering Latin America's revolutionary struggles."
13265,"Episode 19 ""prelude to the first Punic War"" would be a good launching point for The history of Rome. Start of a great story and the worst of the bad audio situation of the early episodes are over. Within about a dozen episodes after that the show really starts to hit its stride.

If you have a free audible credit laying around his first book Storm before the Storm may actually be the best place to start since it's much more polished and cohesive. I also absolutely loved his second book on the marquis de Lafayette.

For revolutions I'd recommend starting off with the French revolution which is season 3. It's a slow burn but I found it way more compelling than the first two which I would consider some of the ""sloggiest"" of his whole catalog. 

More than anything a very slight bump in the playback rate can also do wonders. Most shows I listen to at 1.5x but I ended up listening to most of his shows at 1.1x since there is alot of information to process but the slight increase really helps the pacing. This maybe more than anything well help with the focusing aspect. 

I'm sure his style won't go over with everyone but I highly recommend one more go because the potential payoff is huge"
13266,I started with the grachi brothers because I kinda understood that era. I have troublev listening when i know nothing and the early stuff is very myth heavy
13267,Start from the late republic I say. That's the wildest time. Definitely don't start from the first few episodes as he was still finding his feet.
13268,I listen to Mike Duncan to put me to sleep. This podcast is not mean to be watch while working out or exercising.
13269,"I've only ever heard it pronounced that way, myself. Pleebians and pleebs."
13270,"I like BHP, but my god does he need a harsher editor. Textbook example of using lots of sentences when few were needed to make the point."
13271,"Yeah Wyman is great and his analysis is always really well done. His guests are also awesome. I'm also a history student, so it's great to listen to a podcast relating to courses I take. I also highly recommend his recent book, The Verge, which explores the transitional period between the 15th and 16th centuries. It especially looks at the Renaissance, Reformation, and exploration. His chapter on Martin Luther and Reformation is my favorite"
13272,"While I'm dreading the end of the History of Byzantium, I'm very excited to see what Robin does next. You nailed it on not being Mike Duncan, but he's clearly a massive influence on Robins style. The 100th episode when he had Mike on is one of my favourite episodes, even though it has very little to do with the narrative. Loved hearing Robin fanboy a bit. Really looking forward to the interview with Professor Kaldellis"
13273,That would be awesome to me. I love those kinds of YouTube docs.
13274,They really hate the french
13275,"The company which owns them does another podcast I listen to, which also have similar ad breaks and timeframes. It's probably to make it more friendly to advertisers so they know when their thing will be advertised"
13276,Thanks! I'll give it a listen.
13277,I criticize it because I love it. It really is a great podcast. I think the reason I point that out is because I found their latest podcasts on the 100 years war to be quite biased and perpetuates all the myths about arms and armor that have been debunked for years. I  shouldn't blame them however as they aren't medieval arms and armor specialists
13278,You just articulated something I had an issue with them but couldn't pin point it myself. Thank you. I obviously didn't find it as much of an issue with it but I noticed it most in a topic I knew more about. Have you ever heard of History on fire? I find it to be the best history podcast out there besides hardcore history
13279,"As a former downtown Oaklander, I think I would consider uptown to be a part of downtown."
13280,I tried to paint my house while listening. Not fun when your phone is covered in paint after the first episode or two.
13281,"Most cars have can have their steering wheel controls do this and you can set it to the same skip interval you would normally use (15 sec, 30 sec, etc)"
13282,it's uptown now!
13283,"Some I really enjoyed:
504 - about the ""bleep"" censored sound
525 - about the punk venue wars in LA Chinatown
488 - about the international foods aisle
428 - about Minneapolis' skyway walkway system 

but honestly, part of the fun is learning about something you had NO previous interest in and getting sucked in. there was an episode about duty free shops and i was amazed at how interesting it turned out to be."
13284,Jump in on any topic that interests you
13285,"They do not need to be listened to in order (there are a handful of ~4 episode series they released, so watch out for those and do them in order). 
I enjoyed recent episode 524 and 525. The Mini Stories episodes released each December are also fun."
13286,"While we're all listing 99PI episodes we love, my personal favorite is Episode 221: America's Last Top Model. It's about a very large scale model of the Mississippi River Basin, and I just found it riveting."
13287,"I'm going to disagree with the others.  From the beginning.  Their style and length have changed over the years (in some ways better, and in some worse), and listening from the top shows where they started and why it's become so beloved."
13288,Mini episodes is what I'd start with
13289,"On the website, you can filter for topics you are interested in. It's supposed to be a podcast about how design influences how we experience the world, but almost everything can fall into the category of design."
13290,404:on Onate's Foot
13291,"From the beginning, it cool to see how the show evolved too."
13292,You can certainly just jump in.
13293,"Well, 99% Invisible is called that because it's an audio podcast. You can't see the sound waves, only the logo and episode info."
13294,Funny because he looks exactly like I'd expect. Maybe without the beard. What did you expect?
13295,"That's a problem I have with a lot of podcasts unfortunately. Roman Mars' voice is just on the edge of too much for me; I can listen to one episode at a time but no more. I think some people try a little too hard to make every individual word sound interesting, rather than taking a step back and letting the content be interesting on its own. It's gotta be a very tough thing to navigate, because a good voice or a particular rhythm can add a lot of life to the information, and being audio-only there are only so many ways you can enhance the experience, but man there are some podcasts I would really like to listen to but just can't get past the host. There's a lady on a lot of Parcast's shows that just way overacts every sentence and ruins almost every one I listen to- and they seem to put her on so many!"
13296,It's actually good. His voice is a bonus.
13297,"I'm most of the way through that book right now.

It's hard, yeah, but I've also felt like it's been very validating. Like oh ok, I'm not just driving wrong or something, cars really weren't built for me. I'm not bad at speaking, voice assistants were trained on mostly-male voices."
13298,I think about this one all the time!
13299,And they never ran out of topics.
13300,"Bonn, Germany"
13301,"Kinda sad, i used to love it"
13302,Good to know! Maybe I should revisit.
13303,Yes.  Yes it was.
13304,The bit where he goes to kiss his wife (possibly before going to a heroic death?) but there are people watching so they hug instead is one of the most tragically sexless things I've ever heard. I was *howling*
13305,"That line... 

His first draft had to have been ""*I'd* take a bullet for you, babe"". But it didn't quite feel right. Then one day, as he was playing that phrase over and over in his mind, Ben wondered if there was any way to make it... more smoothed out from repetition, catchier, more distinctive. 

Ben never knew where the best ideas came from: are they divine inspiration? Are they encoded in his genes? Or are they simply the results of his own tireless effort and determination? It's a mystery. But then, suddenly, in a flash, it came to him. 

""Take a bullet for you, babe"". 

Ben's eyes shone as spoke the words aloud, picturing them coming from the mouth of his tough, masculine, and very tall hero, with his deep sexy voice. *That's the line*, thought Ben. He could already see it playing in the trailer of the inevitable movie adaptation, the one that would put those Hollywood elitists to shame. 

He set to work, his smile growing ever wider as he scoured through the manuscript, deleting every superfluous ""I'd"". The rapid clack-clack-clack-clack of his backspace key echoed in his ears, growing and swelling until it became a thunderous roar of applause."
13306,I hate that I haven't read the book AND I haven't even listened to the podcast about it but that line is memed so much that it makes me think about him anyway
13307,"Explode out my insides with searing hot metal for you, babe."
13308,User name checks out.
13309,paging /u/thebenshapirobot/
13310,Our avatars look kinda similar.
13311,What a fucking dork.
13312,"If you ever wonder why Shaps is bitter, remember that he wanted to be a screenwriter and wrote *this*"
13313,What episode is that?
13314,Star running back for the high school.....nobody knew his name.
13315,"so hilarious that his ""bear of a man"" is actually just a reasonably athletic build for a man of his size."
13316,"""A BEAR of a man, standing six foot three in his BARE feet."""
13317,Who was black.
13318,"Real name:  unknown.
Build:  behemoth.
Future:  lifetime of prison workouts."
13319,It was where they read Ben Shapiro's book. Search Ben Shapiro and it will come up. That one and where they read Steven Seagal's book are so funny I actually had stomach pain.
13320,"PRODUCTS!!!!!!!


services."
13321,The Knife Missile: for when you only want to kill *most* of the people in that bus.
13322,Is your Afghan wedding too put together? A missile from Raytheon will make sure that wedding is spread out more than it needs to.
13323,And you know where you can use a knife missile? A secluded island where you can hunt children courtesy of Blue Apron.
13324,"And you know what we'll do with the money we make through the following advertisements for products and services? That's right. We're gonna buy a bunch of LGM-25C Titan IIs, re-arm them, and watch with a joyous tear in our eye as they descend upon the Great Lakes, instantly turning them to vapor; the resulting clouds of which will solve the California drought while simultaneously allowing us to take our vengeance for the crew of the Edmund Fitzgerald.



But yeah.. **PRODUCTS!!**"
13325,The best thing about the Raytheon knife missile bit is that people think THAT's a joke - but are perfectly willing to accept the Blue Apron child hunting island as fact :D
13326,"Just yesterday my mom asked ""have you ever heard of Raytheon? They have positions open and an office over in X""

I almost spit and immediately responded ""you mean the people who build the knife missile? Mom I can't work for a company that blows up Yemeni school buses"""
13327,Don't forget about the California Highway Patrol!
13328,"i work for a law firm, and raytheon once tried to retain us to pursue a non-paying vendor. all i could hear was those f'ing joke ads on loop."
13329,I'd rather have a missile knife
13330,I was blown away when I found out Raytheon actually does make a knife missile.
13331,I'm interested in learning more about this knife missile....
13332,"That people thought Robert was serious about there being an island just floored me.  Or maybe his explanation as to why he stopped doing that bit was a bit within a bit, in which case, well played."
13333,"Please, it's hardly a genocide if they're allowed to hide from the hunters"
13334,Bagel chucking and the poison room.
13335,And the throwing bagels of yore.
13336,"""Have you ever been to Sizzlers?""

""Follow up: What's the most amount of shrimp you've thrown up in one sitting?""

I had my headphones on and was laughing so hard that my wife thought there was something wrong with me."
13337,"Doritos, not dictators."
13338,"The Devil's Chessboard is about the Dulles brothers and their rise to power, a couple evil motherfuckers. It's a phenomenal book.

The Devil's Chessboard: Allen Dulles, the CIA, and the Rise of America's Secret Government: https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/24723229"
13339,"Anybody who says ""I don't like Republicans, but John McCain was pretty cool"" should be forced to listen to *The Dollop* episode about him too."
13340,"The Dulles episodes are required listening and will make you forever despise the CIA and the Republican Party. Vile bastards that should have been tarred, feathered and set on fire"
13341,"Same with the non-nazi bastards who helped the nazis, school of the Americas, Phyllis Schlafly, and The John Birch Society."
13342,Haven't listened to Kissinger yet but have listened to Dulles bros. Fucking insane the shit they got away and we will be dealing with the fallout to this day and likely forever
13343,"Ah yes. The other series I couldn't listen to and be doing something else. Almost cut a finger off listening to the Dulles brothers and doing dishes. Don't do that. It's bad for you. I got a nice flap, and couldn't get stitches."
13344,Just finished this one yesterday!
13345,"It's amazing how two people directly fucked US foreign policy directly and indirectly for 40 odd years.

Like the red scare was going to happen regardless but those fuckers just turbo charged it."
13346,Why?
13347,So does the host of this podcast
13348,You're going to LOVE Robert lol
13349,There's a great line from those episodes where one of the guests describes him as the Forrest Gump of War crimes.
13350,"I knew that fuck Henry Kissinger, but listening to the podcast series on him made me realize I didn't despise him half as much as he deserves."
13351,"One super cursed thing you'll learn in that series is that people really wanted to actually fuck him.
He was considered quite the ladies man."
13352,"The host said he wanted the series on him to be called ""Henry Kissinger: dick sucking toilet"""
13353,Can you believe this fucker is *still* alive?
13354,"Fuck Kissinger, that fucking Nazgul."
13355,Go check it out. You're gonna love it. Fuck Henry Kissinger indeed!
13356,I have a special bottle of champagne for when he dies.
13357,"To quote the host ""the Forrest Gump of war crimes"""
13358,The Forrest Gump of war crimes.
13359,"I just found out the other day that that fucker was still alive. I was shocked, I thought he'd been dead for at least a decade.  99 year old piece of shit while my ride or die best friend just died in her sleep for no apparent reason at 53. (oh shit, crazy how grief will just sneak up and kick your ass at 7:30 am)."
13360,And kiss Henry Fuckinger.
13361,"You know a lot of people were saying that at the time too, just for different reasons...."
13362,I knew Kissinger was involved in lots of war crimes. But wow he was involved in like ALL modern war crimes.
13363,Last Podcast on the left done an amazing 3 o 4 parter on Mengele
13364,I'm probably going to wait for that fucker to croak before I listen to that one. I usually tap out when the person is still able to effect change.
13365,They're comparable imo. You're gonna hate Henry Kissinger afterwards
13366,"That's a tall order but if I had to pick one guy to do it, it'd be the German SS officer who's nickname was ""the angel of death."""
13367,They had a running joke about Blue Apron running an island where you can pay to hunt children for sport. They stopped joking about it because there's apparently a non-zero amount of totally clueless people who took it seriously and kept messaging the podcast hosts to ask how they could help and shit.
13368,"No, they had to shut that down once the attention got too hot. But they've got a hell of a plan to relandscape the Great Lakes if you're looking to invest."
13369,"That accent is like browned butter. I forget which episode it was but Robert was saying how he changed his podcast voice/ covered his accent because he knows his content gets more respect. And BWD was like ""yea and I could cover up my accent, but I don't because I'm trying to be funny, and this accent fits that perfectly""

I definitely poorly paraphrased that, but I found it super interesting. And ever since I've wondered what Robert's ""real"" voice is like haha."
13370,I like Prop a lot.
13371,Why'd that?
13372,"You're missing out dude, some great episodes recently. The illuminati episodes are great. I really like BWD, and hope he comes back, but I like almost all of their guests tbh. I was also a fan of Cody Johnson from before BTB, who feels like their most common guest."
13373,"Loved the Illuminati episodes where Margaret was a guest. Stuff they talked about sounded like it was a plot thread from a Thomas Pynchon novel, except crazier because it's real life."
13374,She's such a delight!
13375,"Weird, I binged the whole series last year."
13376,Cool stuff. Cool stuff. Cool stuff. Cool stuff. Heinous act. Dies. Great podcast though.
13377,Whatever I gotta do to be in the cult...
13378,Post apocalyptic cyberpunk dystopia? You mean reality?
13379,Is it fiction?
13380,His book isn't a brief history of ice?
13381,I listened to it on apology and its pretty entertaining.
13382,"That's actually the premise, though, for the other person to come in cold. Recently, he changes that up some, but it's not the norm."
13383,Disagree but you can't win em all!
13384,"Oh they switch co-host? Then I might give it another try, listened to the Mengele episode yesterday, but had to stop after half an hour because I just could not take the co-host endlessly interrupting with dumb German accent jokes."
13385,"Absolutely agree, I had to stop listening.

If the co-host wasn't interesting, it was like I was just listening to him read a Wikipedia article."
13386,"It could happen here is such a weird show to be run by a guy who [has admitted to working with the feds](https://twitter.com/IwriteOK/status/1282247746309615617) and [who also makes 400k a year](https://twitter.com/IwriteOK/status/1387867264687484929). Robert Evans spies on Portland BLM protestors in 2020 for the federal government


Just really weird for a show about fascist violence to be run by a fake anarchist making 400k as a spy for the FBI "
13387,"I listened to maybe 90% of BTB over the past 3 months or so. First podcast I've ever listened to. It was such a trip looking up pictures of everyone on the pod haha. Robert *did not* look like I expected. He really is kind of a babe though. [This was the first picture I saw when I first looked him up](https://preview.redd.it/t8a0x2ody3h31.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e4932ae50f64c8d54f84bde8d403e616bf7a72ed) too lol, mixed up who was who at first and was even more surprised.


Edit: He really kind of looks like the result if you typed ""journalist"" into an AI picture generator."
13388,"I love his humor but I don't blame you at all. My Mom loves history and I know she'd like a lot of the topics, but I know she would be put off by the humor, and Robert laughing at terrible stuff (even though that's just kind of his thing, not like he actually thinks it's funny obv). But I wouldn't be able to get through his stuff without his sense of humor tbh. Would just be too depressing."
13389,Lol. They aren't ready for him over there.
13390,He's too politically outspoken for the Daily Show
13391,"he also wants to nuke the great lakes. clearly, Robert is the real bastard here"
13392,He doesn't have much say over ads. Except the ones he reads himself.
13393,You're all over this making wild as fuck claims with zero evidence. You sound unhinged. Did Robert fuck your girlfriend/boyfriend or something?
13394,Yo man are you off your meds? What are you on about?
13395,Especially since Robert acts like a second Jordan; it gets really fun imo 
13396,I always say my favorite Seagal movie is Executive Decision because he dies immediately lol.
13397,Oh man. There aren't enough hours in the day to listen to all the episodes I want to. I need to stop scrolling back to old episodes and just give up on the idea of ever catching up lol
13398,STOPPPP!!! YOU'RE KILLING ME!! I'm having some serious fomo now.
13399,He mentioned in Twitter he was doing research into Vince McMahon.
13400,"The L Ron ones are a great jumping off point, he was just such a fascinating piece of shit"
13401,"Second the Thomas one. The man is so utterly beyond evil he should have never been allowed anywhere near a law school.

EDIT: For example - Thomas had an extremely shitty childhood. He believes everyone should have a worse life than he did. He also believes in making anyone on the left, especially women, pay for what he went through with Anita Hill."
13402,"What's funny is that if you listen to some of the older episodes, its definitely more serious and muted"
13403,"Jamie Loftus is one of my favorite BtB guests. But her cohost on The Bechdel Cast, Caitlin Durante, guested once on BtB for the John Landis episodes and was absolutely awful. I couldn't believe that she has her *own* podcast about *film!* She was ignorant, boring, and rarely responded verbally to what Robert was saying. So frustrating!"
13404,Doggy doggy what now? How the hell did I miss the one with Paul F. Tompkins??
13405,What ep was Chelsea on?
13406,I love Patton! I'll check those out.
13407,I think that's The Dollop which is also an amazing podcast.
13408,"I can't find that one. What's the episode number or date, please?"
13409,Wait Reagan episode with Patton Oswalt? When the fuck did i miss this I don't remember that at all.
13410,Margaret Killjoy specifically needs to shutup.
13411,It's bizarre that multiple people in this thread have claimed that they make shit up but none of them have actually provided examples when asked
13412,"I found the Chris Chan one was (unfortunately because his whole life is documented),an easy example of this. They went certain directions to fit their views and excuse certain things. Some similar things in the General Butt Naked one. I find the show entertaining if the subject is right, but they certainly shape what they talk about to their world view. For that reason, I don't take what they say as anything but high-level overviews for entertainment purposes."
13413,"Doesn't he often say, ""I'm not saying X but there are signs that point to X.""?"
13414,">Its certainly editorialized and not meant to be taken as a nuanced and accurate history the entire time

but this is the issue imo, because their fans seem to think it is, they're praised in left wing circles as being against the right and establishment, being about facts etc,"
13415,See edit
13416,"Respectfully, but vehemently, I disagree. However, there are plenty of popular hosts out there that I find unlistenable, usually due to my misophonia, so I understand how you feel."
13417,"I kind of doubt that -- like 60% of the reason why jokes are funny are because of timing.

Its not the kind of funny ""haha that was terrible timing!""

It's more like the ""why would you say that"" kind of terrible timing

It doesnt add to or enhance the storytelling -- it halts it

And by flat I dont mean like.. dry humor

I mean flat like he's obviously joking but the joke is kind of weird and not very funny

But again just my perspective. if you think he's funny then all the power to you, I just think a good majority of the time his jokes just serve to completely interrupt the narrative, rather than support it.

That being said, I still listen to the podcast because the material is interesting."
13418,I made the mistake of reading it on a plane surrounded by strangers. It's so sad.
13419,We're here because we're here because we're here because we're here
13420,"You might like the audio book. Each topic is expanded into its own chapter and there are more reviews added too, all narrated by John. I love it."
13421,Yes and such a good/harrowing book!
13422,"""I'll pay for the pizza if you go pick it up"""
13423,"My grandma would always put on Alive, Empire Strikes Back, or Temple of Doom when my mom dropped me off there. I watched that movie so many times as a kid."
13424,Yup
13425,"I have really enjoyed the episodes since Michael left, as expected they've got a different feel overall but the guest experts she gets are great. This Andes rescue one and the audio engineer talking about the recording of Rumours stand out as 10/10 for me"
13426,"I tried to keep listening after Michael left, but it just hasn't been the same. The episodes don't hold my interest at all. On the positive side, his other podcasts (Maintenance Phase and If Books Could Kill) are pretty good!"
13427,"I have become so negatively polarized about any depiction of a disaster or even a difficult scenario that is all doom and gloom. That's not what happens! We see it over and over again but people on the whole want to help each other and they make jokes in the meantime! What else can they do?

Anyway ""drop a bunch of bombs to cause anarchy"" was and often is US foreign policy."
13428,"Pretty sure it's the episode released on October 31, 2022.  It's the one right before the movie rating system."
13429,"I've listened to a bunch and Sarah is still great, but those two together had a energy. I miss it but even now it's still worth listening to."
13430,"I miss Sarah and Mike's chemistry but the new episodes are good, too! Sarah has really good chemistry with Blair Braverman so I recommend any episode where she guest hosts. I also LOVE the recent Amanda Knox episode."
13431,"I've never heard an episode with him, as I've started late.  Really enjoying the show as is.  It's one of my current favorites."
13432,Interesting take - why do you say his credibility dropped?
13433,I've listened to a bit of MP and didn't see anything wrong with it? They seem to back up everything with sources that are reliable from what I remember
13434,"As a Sarah and mike fan I'm curious. Does MP have the ""healthy at any size"" kind of statements?"
13435,Lmao I never pictured him like that. I don't hear that description in his voice at all
13436,Same. Was really enjoying their OJ series but after Michael left they didn't seem to pick it back up and after a while I just stopped listening.
13437,"Agree on s town. It was fine, but don't understand why everyone views it as a revelation"
13438,[deleted]
13439,"Wasn't that a book club episode? They were doing those as extra content that was a bit lighter during the pandemic lockdown

Meanwhile the Anna Nicole episode and Tanya Harding are really good"
13440,Well ahead of you on maintenance phase but I can't get into If Books Could Kill. It just doesn't grab me.
13441,"Oh no! The Searchers isn't really the Searchers, it's the 100th episode Special and it's actually a retrospective."
13442,"I'm so mad at myself, I saw the crew in person last year at a convention and completely forgot to ask Paulo what the Ring even did in that reroll. It's just so weird that Leonard had it for like half of the movie, and as far as I can tell it didn't affect his rolls or anything. It's been driving me crazy!"
13443,"Definitely listen to them. They're very funny, but a bit inconsistent. I both love and hate how fast and loose and crazy they play with the dnd rules.

A lot of times the momentum of the campaign grinds to a halt with the characters angrily arguing with each other for what feels like way too long.

But they're all very funny and talented. It's actually crazy how good Anthony Burch is at roleplaying evil, abusive characters."
13444,It's good!
13445,I think the end of the month it's back!
13446,"Pretty sure this is ""132: What if you were kept from the one you loved most?"" Fucked me up good. One of those you remember where you were & what you were doing when you listened to it."
13447,I don't think to many people know about What Was That Like it really is a great podcast!
13448,"Same! I scrolled and couldn't find it, so I had to add it! I find myself enjoying all of them, even the subjects I might not have otherwise been interested in!"
13449,"Kerry fascinates me, and I mean that in the most derogatory way."
13450,If you go back far enough there are a few episodes on other folks as well like Bill Cooper
13451,Lionel Lionel Lionel
13452,"I had a moment where I decided KF broke my brain. Standing there washing dishes, about three hours into watching a corporate representative get deposed. Not even with the KF commentary. Just the deposition."
13453,On really bad days I go listen to the Stone/Klayman deposition just to lighten my mood.
13454,I never knew I could enjoy depositions as much as I did going and watching those...and I'm a law nerd.
13455,That bill Ayers interview is incredible. Nuff said.
13456,"Given that some podcasts can take months or years to get through the catalogue of, it can be worth skipping if you're interested in staying up to date with the podcast. Not everyone has (or can or wants) to dedicate 4+ hours a day to podcast listening for weeks on end to work through a backlog."
13457,If it's a current events podcast I'm not listening to the back catalog lol.
13458,"I just started the back catalogue.   If figured the first episodes would be rough...  fuck, was I wrong!"
13459,"I don't have the time to dedicate that long listening to podcasts everyday, let alone a single podcast when I've got several others that I also listen to. I love their workrate on KF, but I don't have time to go back and listen to absolutely everything."
13460,"I have a weird thing where I don't enjoy non-current media. More specifically, if a show ever references current events I am literally incapable of listening to old episodes. Same thing with sports, I have to watch live or not at all."
13461,I just favorited and downloaded the Formulaic Objections episodes. It's my favorite playlist
13462,"They are a little timeless in a way, since they hop back and forth through time quite frequently. There's also the added bonus of reliving all the different political culture war nonsense all our denser family members fell into, and depressing once you realize they were just parroting Alex the whole time"
13463,[deleted]
13464,Hey there are dozens of us out there that love Jordan's tennis bright spots! Dozens!!!
13465,"To be honest, given their subject matter, I support Jordan gushing about something that isnt xenophobic. It is akin to Dan gushing about wrestling. I dont care about either, but hearing what gives them joy is infectious."
13466,That's why I only listen to every 5th or 6th episode. I don't know how they stay sane.
13467,"Andi in Kansas, you're on the air thanks for holding....I love you."
13468,Who doesn't!?
13469,You're a loser little tiddy baby!
13470,Daddy shark bomp bomp bomp
13471,My neck is freakishly large
13472,"Specifically, schwetting. He's got that fat guy lisp (speaking from experience)."
13473,It is for a chimera.
13474,"It almost certainly is a fan. I was listening to old episodes and stumbled upon episode #200 where Sasquatch comes up between Dan and JorDan and a lot of the threads from that episode show up years later when the Squatch guy is on Project Camelot. 

I respect Dan for not covering it more and discouraging folks from messing the subjects of the podcast, but that second Squatch episode was some of the funniest bullshit I've ever listened to."
13475,Yeah I need to be a step removed from these assholes. Like I can listen to people talk about these pieces of shit but if I have to hear them directly I can't stand it. The pod was legit becoming negative for my mental health lol.
13476,"That Fuentes one was really, really rough. I had to take a break after that one. I believe it was part of the Ye incident episode...a nasty dumpster fire overall."
13477,"I can't listen to it in my car at all, I get the angriest looks at intersections. But it's one of my all time faves. I love hearing Dan's deep dives, nothing like some effective research after listening to bullshit all day."
13478,"Every time I have it on my earbuds when I'm shopping or whatever, I'm afraid they'll disconnect and my phone will just blare Alex Jones for the whole Kroger to hear."
13479,Paul Rust is such a silly nut. Always love him on Comedy Bang Bang.
13480,"I don't think there is a disingenuous bone in Sona's body. I've listened to every episode, and she feels as authentic as they come."
13481,[deleted]
13482,"When Jeff Goldblum rambles in his way for like a solid minute describing how he feels about this interview and Conan responds with ""Most people just say one word"" was so fucking funny."
13483,"And the Paul Rudd ones. This podcast, as a whole, kept me going on a 5000 mile road trip this past fall."
13484,Conan and Tim have been friends for so long that they can really mess with each other and it's great.
13485,"The second Olyphant one is great too. He had some great lines referring to when he was on set for the upcoming Justified series and actual gunshots started ringing out, sending the crew scrambling for cover.

""Hey babe, I'm still waiting on that protein shake."""
13486,I'm mostly in it for the interactions with Sona and Matt.
13487,Bill Hader is my all time favorite ep.
13488,Timothy Olyphant's slurping or whatever almost caused me to crash my car.
13489,"The second ones are great too, I like them both. Also, Julie Bowen was hilarious, she fangirls so hard and when they do the vagina voice I almost died."
13490,The Kevin Nealon episode that dropped last fall is the dumbest episode I have ever listened too but holy shit was that funny
13491,"The Kevin Nealon episode is my favorite. Kevin does some absolute ADHD driven sabotage and it becomes hilarious

Edit: Autocorrect turned Nealon to Nelson"
13492,The first Kevin Nealon and the Will Arnett episodes are top tier.
13493,"My favorite is Charles Barkley making fun of Conan's hands: ""Don't touch me with those tiny hands!"""
13494,That Timothy Olyphant one is brilliant. I had no idea he was so hilarious. Silenko!
13495,The Goldblum episode where they just make sexy grunts at each other for like three minutes straight. I was crying
13496,"I'd throw any ep with John Mulaney in the ring as well. The back-and-forth between he and Conan is always so good, and makes sense given they're both ~~Boston~~ Irish Catholics who work in comedy."
13497,"Ok, this is probably the right place to ask: What is the deal with so many repeat guests? I find the rehash interviews so dull, even when the first interview was enjoyable. The team have to avoid the more obvious and interesting topics covered in the original interview. There just seems to be so much more boring small talk. The whole conversations feel like hard work. The second Paul Rudd interview convinced me not to bother with the returning guests anymore."
13498,Gourley was such a great addition to the Sona/Conan dynamic.  They've had others step in for him or Sona and it feels completely off in the intro/ending.
13499,"Thanks for this, I'll check these out. I've asked before and the usual response is Fly On the Wall with Spade and Carvey. I listen to that one too but it's not even in the same league as CONAF."
13500,I mean when someone says his talkshow interviews were great... There good by the standard of talk show interviews. Like a pre planned conversation that both sides know what they're going to say... Pretty much hit or miss based on the guest.
13501,You're getting downvoted for the truth. He gets upset if anyone is the funny one and not him and he drives jokes into the ground. He's like SNL on steroids. The joke was funny for the first 15 seconds but then he keeps doing slight variations for 2 minutes and you're like OKAY I GET IT. That being said Timothy Olyphant and Jeff Goldblum eps were fantastic.
13502,"I think those two should work on a movie together. Now that Bill has been directing and probably gets a lot of freedom now, they could probably make gold"
13503,"""By the end of this century, we will have the right dogs fuck each other..."" had me in stitches"
13504,Fuckman's Leap!
13505,"Gourley has a looooooong history of improv. Virtually all the podcasts he does and guests in are all improv shows. Theres a reason they call him the podcast king, dude's portfolio is huge. I loved him and conan separately since they worked in different mediums, but id never think id hear his voice on a conan podcast. Its like having your favorite chef and poet, two people you think would never meet end up in the same show"
13506,"If you are a fan of the James Bond movies at all, Gourley co-hosts the James Bonding podcast and he's hilarious on there as well!"
13507,"Gourley is the best. If you want to do a deep dive into some insane podcasts you can listen to his old ones: Superego and Pistol Shrimps Radio. 

Super Ego is a highly produced improv podcast and it's bananas. It's also like 10-15 years old. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOzZw0OwS9Y

One of my favorite skits from the entire series. 

Pistol Shrim's Radio is where Fuckman's leap came from. Matt Gourley would eat an entire bag of sourpatch kids and go on hour long sugar fueled rants. It was a thing of beauty."
13508,"Matt sometimes takes it too far and seems to try too hard, even tho he gets an authentic laugh from Conan I just wish there was, at times, less Gourley. Give me all the Sona tho"
13509,"""Steve Barton.... Is it Steve Martin or Steve Barton?"""
13510,"I mean, the way he explained it made it obvious that that was best for all involved?  Especially when he's wearing a half bottle of Joop..."
13511,Would that even work?
13512,"And the bit about preparing chicken breasts for bbq, I was dying"
13513,"And the bit about preparing chicken breasts for bbq, I was dying"
13514,"Oh yeah, the part where bill burr talks about laughing at the news was totally like wtf"
13515,My memory is rusty but I'm pretty sure this is Marty roasting conan. I just love how backhandedly mean he is
13516,"the caption on his headstone saying ""almost"""
13517,Yes! So true. His episode w/ Jeff Goldblum absolutely kills me every time lmao. Their energy together is hilarious.
13518,"Thanks for the recommendation! I listened to the first episode and am gonna be binging this for sure.

I would start on Ep 1 of Normal Gossip, TBH."
13519,This week's episode was great!
13520,It's s3 ep 1
13521,I desperately want to know what that bird lamp looked like.
13522,"Tim Harford. Incredible storyteller. The episode ""The Hero Who Rode His Segway Off a Cliff"" had me tearing up."
13523,Tim Harford.
13524,Indeeeeed.
13525,I love the banter! Listening feels like hanging out with friends.
13526,"> they have great chemistry together. 

Have you listened to the recent crossword episode? It sounded like Chuck was going punch Josh! It was such a strange departure from their normal vibes. Apparently they got a bunch of mail saying that Chuck needed to chill tf out."
13527,"But Chuck is hilarious. If it were just Josh it wouldn't have as much emotion IMO. Josh is very factual and logic driven, I enjoy the chaos Chuck brings to the show."
13528,"There's a lot of folks in here going ""I'm an expert on X and spent years of my life studying it. WHY COULDN'T THEY SUM THIS UP 100% CORRECTLY WITHIN 35 MINUTES?!"" 

I think you just answered your own question there, bud."
13529,Yes! The fluoride one really got under my skin.
13530,So should i listen? I would love to know more stuff but i don't think I'll do it on my own. Is the podcast trash or is it good for a tldr of subjects?
13531,"There are other edutainment/infotainment podcasts that do research even though they're for that kind of vibe. Sawbones, Maintenance Phase, you're wrong about, Ologies and more"
13532,[deleted]
13533,Damn. This is depressing.
13534,"Infotainment should still be factually accurate. It has to be real info, it can't be just -tainment."
13535,"Everybody's wrong about things or makes mistakes.

You have to consider the consequences of being wrong with the information and seek additional sources as necessary.

Being mistaken about possums and ticks is very different than being wrong about bridge building. You can talk about possums after listening to SYSK, you probably need more research before building a bridge.

This is true for all media, not just podcasts."
13536,"You can't read Wikipedia when you drive or go for a run, though."
13537,What facts are wrong?
13538,What was the topic?
13539,"If you actually listened to their show, you would know that you are entirely wrong."
13540,"You are absurdly wrong. They make it clear all the time that they never use Wikipedia for their research. Like, literally. They make a point of it."
13541,"I appreciate how many times ""cremains"" has come up, followed by ""Chuck, we've agreed that this isn't the proper term for cremated remains"" and then ""We did?"""
13542,what a lovely format for a show
13543,I'm partial to the Lewis & Clark episode.
13544,Oh nice! I Definitely gonna check that out!
13545,Two recent episodes that I really loved were the ones about Peripersonal space and the story of John Delorean. They come up with these seemingly boring subjects that turn out to be fascinating
13546,"I will say though that because it's just two laid back guys doing some research, some of their claims are pretty questionable. I listened to them for a while, but I eventually dropped them due to the sheer number of ads(like 6 breaks per 20min episode, it was ridiculous) and a lack of good fact checking."
13547,Lego from like 12 years ago is amazing.
13548,The one about Meals on Wheels is very good.
13549,"My favorite quote is something along the lines of ""Helen Keller is probably spinning at 1000 rpm's in her grave right now"""
13550,"That is such a great idea. Not gonna lie I'd like to steal that idea for myself, not as a podcast but a hobby with someone. Well I don't really have anything to do that with though."
13551,my absolute favorite episodes were the history of public relations and the dyatlov pass one
13552,"But don't listen to them talk about something you know about because you'll suddenly realise they barely know what they are talking about and are just summarizing irrelevant information that they don't really understand.

Ruined the show for me. Don't do an episode about lead if all you're going to do is badly describe what its atomic number is."
13553,"Laid back is correct. I've listened to about every episode and I have them on 2x playback because they tend to talk really slow, whenever I switch to 1x speed they sound drunk. 

I love the content and I learn something new every episode."
13554,H2r gh32h 22 high 2hh 2hhhh hh2hhrhhhh hhhhhrh2hrhh h2rh 2rhh 2h the.hr2hhr 23rh3hh.32h2h r.rrhrh- -2hrhh-3h-h2hhh2h3 3/5 rhhh
13555,"Well there is the occasional swear or quick vulgar joke but nothing bad, it's all family friendly unless they are covering a nonfamily friendly topic definitely."
13556,Hmmm...but what's it about?
13557,I tried it out awhile ago and this was exactly how I felt about it.
13558,"I feel they do go deeper than just Wikipedia but it would be impossible for them to be an expert in all subjects at the rate they pump out episodes. 

I would trade less episodes for more in depth on every episode but since we don't have that I just let it pique my interest to do more research."
13559,Try having some goals in life
13560,Thank you!
13561,Thank you!
13562,"Yep, the amount of times I'm woken up by hard rock or synth wave rendition of their song, too many!"
13563,"I have been lately, too."
13564,That's literally their entire shtick
13565,Cheerfully accepted!
13566,and they popped open! 
13567,Spread as wide as possible?
13568,Like a pomegranate.
13569,"Tears I tell you!

I wish they just had a podcast telling more stories of just their day to day lives, they are too good.

Like James going to a date to be dumped twice or Jamie and his theatre tales or love for the dames, its too good."
13570,"Now zit, and stand for Hair Bisch!"
13571,"And he had that long sentence as petra, about bisch having an asthma attack and going to the private hospital, and it ended with ""do you understand?"" I listened to that so many times! So funny."
13572,Thankyou
13573,Hey! When you get home from 8th grade band I have JUST the rollicking listen for you! Let's go on a long drive!
13574,"And it's hilariously terrible. ""As she lay back with her legs splayed, her lids popped open"""
13575,"Considering most pornos are written by people (i assume), i gathered that much.

So its basically an audiobook?"
13576,The name of the podcast is quite literally what the podcast is about.
13577,"It's pretty literal, the hosts' dad wrote a porno and they read it out loud on the show and make commentary on it."
13578,Lol!  I was just going to say that.  Can hear him say it in my head.
13579,"I don't remember the specifics of that episode (aside from it being McDonalds), so I'm going to go back and listen again. I love all the episodes. Some of the stories just baffle me. Especially when people are dying or getting sick as a result. I could list so many that I love - the ones about Flint, Love Canal, the Dalkon Shield, Bhopal... I could go on. And I love ACC's dry humor.

The Octopus is my favorite because it's literally like all the arms of an octopus. I still eat a fair amount of bananas, but I think about that episode every time I have one. I have the t-shirt, and I tell anyone who will listen to go listen to the episode. And the other one I listed, the Hero, I love because it just makes me laugh that that woman puts on all kinds of ceremonies for herself with actors and that same song. Who is even attending?!? "
13580,"I don't mind banter on some pods, as long as it doesn't go on for 15 minutes (All Bad Things, I'm talking about you). But ACC rocks. The dry humor gets me every time."
13581,"I just found out about it last week in an incidental pod compare session with a colleague. I gave her swindled, she gave me scamfluences. We both left happy. :D"
13582,I lived in Tel Aviv and never knew the history. Gave me a lot more context to why the place is the way it is.
13583,"You're spot on, it's definitely not always about ""the invisible elements of design that shape our world"" but I've been listening for years now and it's *always interesting*. I've listened to every episode and I don't think I've even skipped one. I started listening around ep 90, but went back to #1 and started from there. Still happy to see a notification that a new ep has dropped and listen to it ASAP.

Twenty Thousand Hertz is also brilliant. I love every episode."
13584,The episode about the telephone box in the middle of nowhere!! One the most compelling and touching episodes.
13585,"Their series on Ivy style clothing was incredible. Something I might have only had a passing interest in, but I was enthralled honestly."
13586,"With 99pi, I usually point friends to specific episodes that our conversation happened to remind me of. And if they then get the itch but feel overwhelmed with the 500+ backlog, I often suggest checking the Mini Stories episodes, or just shuffle the playlist. The diverse range of topics makes for a fun pick-whichever-random-episode style of listening :D"
13587,I have this habit of only atarting at the beginning when listening to podcasts. It feels wrong to start in the middle. Even if it doesn't really make a difference.
13588,"In it's current state, it would do a lot better with just releasing fewer episodes. There are still good ones, but it seems like every other episode is just an episode of some other podcast with an intro from Roman. At the very least, these shouldn't be numbered as regular episodes.  
  
The most recent episode was essentially just a long form interview by Roman of someone that wrote a book about the lottery. That simply isn't the content i subscribed for.  
  
I order my podcasts by which ones I listen to most religiously and 99pi has fallen over the last year to the absolute last slot of podcasts that I listen to every episode of."
13589,"It's the purchase by Stitcher. I was listening to the Bijlmer episode the other day, and there is a clear difference on how they delve into the topic. It's more superficial and doesn't have the same, I dunno, production? It feels like they are cutting costs by using less producers and music and focusing more on the US and it doesn't feel as worldly as it used to."
13590,"Indeed, ~~though~~ what I love about 99pi is that they define *design* on a broader spectrum. They also encompass history, sociology, anthropology, even game history etc.

What got me hooked is that on heavier topics, they don't sugarcoat things or shy away from the more difficult parts of history we need to face, but neither do they sensationalize things. Humanity is messy, and 99pi are ***always*** careful to present all the complex nuances. They are never one-sided, and always well-rounded."
13591,"Alright, adding it to my shortlist. You convinced me to :)"
13592,Ya. It's always about design.
13593,Don't forget all the latest news from Mars and AFC Wimbledon!
13594,Man I haven't heard that line in a long time
13595,Sneezing is not normal. I never sneeze.
13596,[Yep](https://youtube.com/shorts/tDXJzuI_fmM?feature=share).
13597,"I did **not** realize SciShow has a podcast! I follow the channel on YT. 

Also, thanks for the heads up om *Delete This!*"
13598,"Well it is a podcast so you don't have to *watch* Hank in it per se...  

But I will say, chatting with John does seem to balance Hank's personality a bit. They are very different people in some ways and it gives a nice contrast in the podcast."
13599,"His Instagram is very much geared towards gen z, which I can abide if he's gonna be the next generation's Science Guy"
13600,I like hank but I've only ever seen his shorts/insta
13601,"Oh my god, I'm glad I could introduce you to that then! They actually have several podcasts featuring many members of the family (which they refer to as ""the McElroy family of podcasts""). 

They were early pioneers of the podcast format, as I understand it! Their DnD podcast *The Adventure Zone* was one of the first major TTRPG podcasts to really take off. 

Love me some Brennan Lee Mulligan, too! 
There's actually a surprising amount of crossover between him, the McElroys, the the Greens, and other cool internet people."
13602,Yay! Any feedback you have would be greatly welcomed. Thanks!
13603,Thank you!
13604,"Yeah, and I feel like out of hundreds of episodes I can count on one hand how many movies a guest has referenced that he hasn't seen!  And he seems to still really keep up with new releases, even really niche limited release ones (based on his best of the year recaps with Nish)--no idea how he has time for it all, between writing/producing/starring in Ted Lasso, writing and producing Shrinking, doing the podcast, *and* still doing stand up."
13605,"I loved the drunk lockdown episodes, Brett was on one, and Ed and James om another one."
13606,"Anytime they have a Taskmaster guest on it's really strong, and Kearns is a legitimate lunatic. Kearns' own podcast is quite funny as well, with him just riffing a paranormal experience story each week. Which also sounds dumb until you realize that it's Kearns riffing and that dude is off his rocker."
13607,I was in stiches on the train when they were talking about him and his brothers simultaneously trying to do the popcorn trick with a holey bread basket
13608,"God the hot toddy bit in the Chowdhry episode made me cry laughing, the man's an absolute lunatic"
13609,"My favorite is the Nish Kumar episode, early on. They're clearly such close friends it makes me happy, plus they're all brilliantly funny and telling stories that have just the right level of embarrassment."
13610,"I thought mescal was actually pretty good! Honestly didn't expect it and he was clearly super excited to be on the show. I still think the ed sheeran one is, for mine, the peak. There was a period of about 5 minutes where a few things came togeyher and james... was james and i honestly was just belly laughing to myself. Shared it with everyone i know, got a few people on board. Just brilliant"
13611,"Adventure Zone also got me into podcasts! It also strengthened my interest in D&D, but I realize that's a contentious opinion among D&D fans."
13612,"im part boy, part car, Boycar, the protector and king of chilladelphia!"
13613,My brother my brother and me got me through 3 hours of commuting everyday. So good lol
13614,"I gave it a try, but the stuff that they talk about is pretty gruesome. Had to stop after one particularly disturbing bit of medical history"
13615,Munch Squad is their best podcast
13616,"Imagine being a grown man and calling something ""soy"" unironically."
13617,They're lovely wholesome boys 
13618,What does this even mean
13619,Sydnee also thought Havana Syndrome was real lmao
13620,No way. I didn't realise that was the same Justin McElroy. I know they occasionally joke about other people called Justin McElroy but I thought they were joking about two different podcast hosts with that name
13621,"Still Buffering. It's Sydnee and her two siblings, and the description of the podcast says it's ""a cross generational guide to the culture that made us."" I haven't listened either, so that's the best I can do."
13622,Sydney's dad does a law podcast called Court Appointed as well.  The whole family has really gone all-in on the format.
13623,Think it's Still Buffering
13624,Ethersea was a great season and Justin DM'ing Steeplechase has been a real treat.
13625,"Well, that exactly why I like it. I just think it's not for you."
13626,"I loved mbmbam to an extreme extent for so many years and then it just... stopped being funny? I can't exactly put my finger on when or why. It just, stopped."
13627,"Learning from this podcast that in that 25 year conscript contract era if a local villager was conscripted the village would host their funeral was wild. Just like ""well, no one survives 25 years in the Russian military so we'll just get this out of the way now"""
13628,[deleted]
13629,"I always liked Nick better than Liam. I'll get my Liam fix in WTYP, but listening to him in two pods is too much for me."
13630,I could not agree more with all your points
13631,"As someone who performs onstage and occasionally MC's various things in ratty bar locales, I get genuinely anxious hearing Griffin end sentences with *""...yuhh-know?""*

It makes me anxious that I have outrageously annoying verbal tics like that and I still don't notice them, because how could Griffin not? He has to listen to recordings of himself *WAY* more than me, he's a successful podcast host/voice actor/actor actor.

No beef with Griffin himself though, I like both the guys. I actually think David is the one who narrates his own interruption more often. David's just die off into silence more often, while Griffin will coax himself into an unrelated rant if not course corrected."
13632,Blank check is the peak of shows I listen to extensively while also being in a constant state of mild fury at the host
13633,#BOWL.
13634,Still not over my man Del Toro losing
13635,"I've been meaning to check out their podcast, thanks for the rec and reminder!"
13636,Yeah I love this one for getting to sleep. As someone with anxiety it's just pleasant to listen to and lighthearted and completely distracts me from those nighttime stress thoughts. If I fall asleep halfway through an episode I don't feel like I'm missing too much either because you just get to hear a little bit about the field in each episode anyways.
13637,"Exactly! That's the problem, the other stories are good but I don't think any other D&D pod crews have even half as much fun as the D&Daddies crew lmao their goofiness makes it more fun for me to listen to"
13638,"Oooo I'mma check that out, thanks for the rec! :D"
13639,"Thanks and I'll go back and check it out, I came late to the original story and was able to listen to it all without waiting. I may see if I can do the same with the new series."
13640,"It's a horror fiction podcast about the new head archivist working at a supernatural research institute going through the backlog of seemingly unrelated written statements from eye witnesses his predecessor left behind and reading them out to be recorded on tapes and having his team follow up on them.

It's very monster of the week at first, but eventually shifts to being very main plot focused.

It covers the whole spectrum of horror, so no matter what you're afraid of, it's probably in there somewhere. Some of the episodes are absolutely terrifying."
13641,If you like SCP stuff you'll like Magnus Archives
13642,"Thanks, noted and when I have the time I'll check it out."
13643,"Absolutely.  The show builds its lore gradually at first.  Things that start as monster-of-the-week end up having more and more connections, and part of the fun in my opinion is discovering that web alongside the characters as they react and change as a result."
13644,"Definitely a show that needs to be watched in order. It may not seem like it at first, but I dont reccomend skipping episodes or skipping around."
13645,"I do agree that season 5 was the weakest season, but the romance plot was being telegraphed as early as season 3 iirc."
13646,"After relistening to S1, I think it had a much stronger start because the characters and their quest were easier to get behind. They were kinda shitty in a fun way, and the teens are shitty in an annoying way at first. I think it took them a bit longer to feel their roles out, but I think S2 has had some bangers so far. Unfortunately it took about 20 episodes to get there but I think it's hitting its stride now."
13647,"I'm digging season two, but I know a lot of people aren't so much. Check out Pretending to be People if you're looking for something with the same vibe. They're really funny, the production is top notch, and they've got a similar style of role playing to the daddies. They even had Beth as a guest on an episode! Becca Scott just did a 4 episode arc with them that was hilarious"

13674,"Besides the ones already listed, i got some favorites:

* [Cereal Men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxTpjhCaVQM) - You'll never ever look at Graham crackers or Kellogs cereal the same way ever again. The story involves lots of interesting takes on nutrition and its affect on sex/masturbation. A chair that shakes so hard that you shit yourself and child mutilation are just some of the disturbing highlights.

* [The Real Crocodile Dundee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx8RbFvzMmg) - You know the Crocodile Dundee movies? They're based on a real guy and he's a lot different than the movies. The story involves lots of meth and freemasons.

* [Two indigenous actors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gj3TqM59738) - A story about Native American actors and the unbelievable racism that was common during the Lone Ranger tv/radio show. You know that famous commercial about a Native American shedding a single tear because of pollution? Spoiler: he's actually an Italian immigrant.

* [1908 New York to Paris Car Race ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssM1T_YkVL8) - Really think about that title. Notice any problems? A truly ridiculous spectacle.

* [Proctor and Satan ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UYuA1Ox7EU) - You know Procter & Gamble? They had a major satanist panic in the 80s, because Amway distributors spread rumors that P&G are satanists. It got so bad that they had to address it on their hotlines and make public statements about it.

* [The Truck Nuts War ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw_1638FHqY) - Ever wondered about those ridiculous bull testicles hanging off redneck trucks? This Dollop is about the two geniuses that both had the idea on their own and got in a fight.

* [The New Jersey Shark Attacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHQywwl_IWU) - There was a time when sharks were apparently considered good natured and harmless.

* [Errol Flynn ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJTI67Ugdo) - Hollywood star Errol Flynn truly did some living. He drank hard, did all the drugs, slept with/raped countless women and had just about every STD ever."

Just nullified your own point there FYI. Throwing propaganda words around like that just makes people tune you out, for future reference."
13715,"I've started listening to the podcast in the pandemic, I'm going steadily through their backlog and am looking forward to listening to that in a few episodes."
13716,"Agreed. The old episodes are great, but the last couple of years the tone has gotten markedly darker"
13717,I'll try some of those! I've heard great things about it maybe that was just a rough episode.
13718,I gave one episode a shot but it was like two edgy 15 year olds that just discovered cuss words and then one guy went on the unfunniest five or ten minute long rant about fucking Frank Lloyd Wright's sister. I decided it wasn't for me.
13719,"You can just....read a fucking book or watch a YouTube video about history my guy. It's literally a comedy podcast first and foremost lol. The entire point of the fucking thing is Dave reads the story so Gareth can react and do bits.

I love when people don't find something funny others do so they get like, mad at it. It's not for you. Shut up and move on, you don't need to rant about it not being the type of show you wanted lol, you don't like it go do your own."
13720,"DA is also a garbage human. I mean, don't get me wrong, he's not really racist or anything, but he is jaded, cynical, unreasonable, pompous...curmudgeonly, I guess. He's also one of the sweetest people I've ever met. I took a trip out to LA from Texas about twelve years ago and I met up with him at Largo. I was actually there to see his show and I had posted online that I was looking for a place to stay that night and he offered up his couch. This was when his son was like three or four and I felt like that was a real dumb move on his part, to let a stranger come and stay at his house, so I turned it down (and maybe saved him from getting chewed out by his wife). I'll never forget the offer, though. But, he's also kind of a dick. He refused to take a picture with me, I had to take a picture with his exposed belly, instead.

Edit: Jesus, I didn't think I would need to explain a comment like this, but... I stand by what I said, both ends of the spectrum. On a personal level, Dave can be an asshole and he knows it. He will start an argument, just to argue. He is also, by far, one of the best people I've ever met. He has a really good heart, he just hides it well. Yeah, maybe ""garbage human"" was a bit too much."

13735,"I think you may have the right of it there. TAL has been a radio program long before podcasts so it makes sense it would have made the transition to digital distribution early and easily. Now there's so many podcasts, many of which with middling to poor audio quality, that it can be difficult to hack through the weeds to find good content. It's like trying to find a good video game prior to and just after the video game crash of 1983. There's just so much more garbage to wade through finding the good stuff can seem overwhelming or impossible without threads like this one to use as a guide."

I get that we've been lied to about North Korea our whole lives to the point we think of it as nothing more than an almost comical dystopia and even suggesting otherwise is widely considered 'wrongthink', but after listening to that season how could any reasonable person 1. not feel some sympathy for the Korean people especially once you're aware of the absolute horrors the US unleashed on the peninsula and 2. ever take any South Korean or US reporting on North Korea seriously?

Like, the US went very close to full nazi in the war and ongoing occupation, doesn't it give you some pause and make you reconsider what you know about a country when all the news you've ever gotten about it originates  from the same entity who attempted a genocide against that country?"

Bad Friends is one where I feel like they spend too much time cutting away from conversation to do a bit, and the Always Sunny pod is one that definitely feels very structured and, therefore, a little more formal (thanks to Meg, of course).

All this in the midst of cracking wise and generally not taking themselves seriously whatsoever.

13835,"Absolutely. I don't care about Austin either but I love them both and just getting to hear them banter about their lives and friendship is well worth it. It's also great to hear Eric as he chimes in as well. I find myself even re-listening to episodes. It's a nice, laid back podcast that's fun to listen to."
13836,One of us!
13837,"For sure. I've been an RT fan for years and love ANMA but I didn't mention it because I feel that one is mostly enjoyable for RT fans. All their other podcasts are good listens even for non RT fans. I used to listen to Black Box Down and Red Web too but I don't have as much time for podcasts these days so I tend to prioritize FF, FJ and ANMA"

13841,Gotta get a new shirt now
13842,"Oh dang, really?  I'm a diehard fan of both shows and I absolutely hated the crossover episode.  Not knocking your view of it, just trying to gain a different perspective.  Adal's silliness and clear disregard to the world building really took me out of the narrative.  It also felt like he kept trying to be the main character in a podcast clearly not about him.  I felt like Erin was just playtesting her character on SitcomD&D.  JPC felt the most in universe as a big dumb idiot.  
 
 I haven't listened to that episode since release, so maybe I missed a few things.  What did you like about it?  (for the record, i loved when Carly Monardo and Branson went on HRR)"
13843,"I'm British, so I thought it was some weird American thing to be this super nice to each other. The Ben Affleck one recently made me unsubscribe because it was so nauseating.

13850,"I agree the history episodes are fantastic especially the Gilles de rais. The connection between a mass child murdering psychopath heavily intertwining with a saint's life, saving her multiple times is battle and arguing the point he may be the only reason she became a saint, was such a captivating storyline."

13857,"Which episode is that? I can't seem to find it and would love to give it a listen 

*Edit* 
After a lot of searching...
Episode 418 for anyone reading this in the future!"
13858,I was jogging and had to stop for ten minutes due to laughter when Henry read out the story about the croissant in the tree in Krakow. That guy is honestly one of the funniest story tellers I've ever heard
13859,Is that from dulce? Lol. I'm going to delisted to that today
13860,I first listened to the scungili man bit with headphones on while I was nursing my daughter to sleep. I was almost dying trying not to laugh and wake her up.
13861,The Donner party series is always the first one I show people/tell them to watch when reccomendjng the show to someone. It's got the perfect amount of history with the morbidity (but not too dark where it turns someone away from it) and it's absolutely hilarious (Henry's Richard Dreyfuss lmao)
13862,Mormon series is amazing too my favourite along with Donner party.

13876,They have cut back on that with more recent episodes I found

13892,Nick Mullen is the funniest human on earth right now.
13893,Well they're a little late for that anyways.
13894,That show is top tier offensive humor.

13896,"Sorry its an American term, mate"
13897,Shut up you civilian
13898,On episode 43. Unreal how funny these two are together. Matt's lion king bit about Kim Jong Un has to be one.of the most hilarious bits I have ever heard. Genius.
13899,No. RAP is for losers.
13900,Thank god for Lovett or Leave It as well for helping me stay informed without making me clinically depressed.
13901,"If you have ever met any of the hosts in person, their podcast is more their Twitter persona then how they act in real life."
13902,"Their books are great too - especially the first one, which is great primer on critical thinking."
13903,I eventually went back and listened to the older episodes. Steve is such an inspiration!
13904,"It's been years since I listened to it, so I don't think I can provide you with a more detailed  explanation than I found the hosts really annoying."
13905,FULL OF COMEDY BALLAST HEATH ENRIGHT
13906,I've subscribed now. Curious to see what it's about.
13907,"Citation Needed is also a show by Tom Scott and friends where Tom has a Wikipedia page in front of him and the others have to start guessing it's content based only on the name.

I swear it's a lot better and funnier than I made it sound!"
13908,I liked it more when they focused on the science or tech angle of a subject. Over the years it has drifted more towards social stories to the point that it is just a TAL clone.
13909,Lost its way almost a decade ago at this point
13910,Or rather changed direction?
13911,New episodes sometimes. Mostly reruns. 
13912,"Yeah I stopped listening to it a couple years ago when it turned into 90% reruns, but for those who haven't listened to any of it, I highly recommend it. Great quality stuff."
13913,This is exactly what I feel happened to Invisibilia.
13914,I feel like that happened to several NPR podcasts.
13915,The entire archive is online for classic episodes Spotify doesn't have
13916,"I think it was about cancers. I wrote a thesis on tasmanian devils facial tumours and studied tumour immunology.

It might also have been about the secret communication between trees using fungi. I'm not an expert in that but a good friend (who now runs his own research lab) explained to me how flawed large elements of that episode were."
13917,I'd also be interested in this
13918,"Ah I've heard this defined before. I've come to hate pop-science in general because I know it's over simplifying things. I know they mean well and those channels want to be good science communicators, but I just can't listen/read/watch them any more.

However, I love listening to podcasts about economics, something I know little about formally."
13919,Exactly. It's like they retained all the worst aspects of the show while getting rid of any substance.
13920,"Can you expand on this? There are some other podcasts I want to like but their editing (or lack of) frustrates me so much, I can't stand to listen to them. Ive been listening to Radiolab for years and this isn't something I've noticed. Not trying to argue or counter your point, genuinely curious."
13921,Yeah it's unlistenable
13922,"I could count on my hands how many drinks I've had since listening to the episode on alcohol a few months ago. Half way through I just decided to stop drinking , was going through a case a week before too. 
Fantastic podcast"
13923,And his most recent episode on dopamine is super useful.
13924,I take notes when listening to his podcast
13925,"What? As far as I understand his whole motto is ""science backed tools for everyday life"". What specifically do you have an issue with?"
13926,"I've never purchased a supplement from him. He does state time and time again that other things should be tried first, like behavioral changes, before using supplements or otherwise spending money..."
13927,"""Bro science"" is a term largely used to describe a certain flavor of pseudoscientific thought and communication of that thought as it pertains to human physiology and fitness. Usually it's found when someone assumes something they've heard from other people in a fitness community (whether it's bodybuilders, dieters, athletes, or otherwise) is true, without seeing the actual research (if any has been done at all) to back up those claims. Oftentimes ""bro science"" claims are built on assumptions using outdated research, or the personal opinions of gym-goers and trainers.

It's been a long while since I've listened to one of his episodes, so I'd find it hard to point to something specific without going back to look. I generally found that he lacked skepticism in the claims of the individuals he brought on. He made personal health recommendations built on extremely fragile studies, including supplement use."
13928,Right? So confused  Must be some overlap from Rogan or something I guess.
13929,"He goes far beyond what a RD, MD/DO, PT would advise. If he stopped where you're suggesting his catalog would end at 20hr of podcasting.

Unfortunate reality is listeners are taking his word as gospel. He continues to overstate the clinical significance of nonclinical studies to an audience unable to discern this nuance -- average person in not qualified to scrutinize articles and lacks a frame of reference to contextualize his claims"
13930,"The average person does not have the education to scrutinize studies. Very small subsect of the population could actually do it, which is why it's disingenuous for him to present information like this. 

He's not at a medical conference or publishing work to a journal for review -- he's doing a 1 way journal club without the other researchers in the room to tease thru the info"
13931,"It's sad because I like what he's trying to do: promote health and further the averages dudes understanding of science.

What he needs is like half a dozen clinical researchers, public health experts, and clinical informatics physicians on a panel and they just do a journal club. Would be a lot less sexy but would be way more genuine for the listeners than arguing a point then backing it with studies. Shouldn't be required to ""do your own research"" after listening to a speaker, the research should be done and you should be hearing from all dissenting views simultaneously"
13932,"Wait, really?"
13933,I had no idea! I would occasionally go back to search for the random free episodes they would release.
13934,"Right there with ya, buddy!"
13935,Same!
13936,I feel like the show does a great job of building tension to make the show way scarier than it has any right to be.
13937,"He has gotten better! 
I remember starting to listen around episode 5 or so and literally thinking they had used a text - to - speech tool to read the podcast. Like it was some new fad or something to have AI podcasts. He has since learned a lot and is actually going back and re-recording all of the older episodes if you feel like giving it another try."
13938,I'm convinced that Aaron Mahnke is a hypnotist. I can almost never make it through an episode without falling asleep.  I'm sure there's some hypnotic suggestion in the last 1/3 of the episode that I am falling victim to.
13939,His 3 part series on the Dyatlov Pass was my favorite work of his
13940,"I liked Unexplained much more, so much so that it freaked me out and I had to stop listening after a couple seasons."
13941,"I always feel a little short changed when I listen to unexplained though, the episodes are so short. 

I tend to stockpile them and listen to a couple at a time"
13942,I'll check it out!
13943,I feel the same way - try Unexplained instead. It's basically Lore but more in-depth and interesting.
13944,My 4am brain thought this was really funny. Thanks!
13945,I also love his voice/cadence. It's so relaxing. My favorite podcast to listen to on a rainy day.
13946,"Same, I like how quiet and peaceful his voice is."
13947,I could definitely see that
13948,It's my go to for when I'm struggling to fall asleep. Works most of the time...
13949,I feel like that would just drive me insane faster.
13950,I believe they have actually been remaking the earlier episodes. His voice gets a lot better. You can always go out of order on episodes too and start with the lastest ones
13951,"Strong disagree... It sounded way too dull and robotic.. I haven't listened to this podcast, but don't think I could based on Frankenstein"
13952,"I tried getting into this but couldn't do it. Some parts were really good, but every other episode is like ""there's no interesting story to be told here, but if you're ever in this one random village in Belgium and see a three foot tall man with blue hair and golden boots you'd better strap a chicken to your head or he'll climb through your windows and put salt on all your chairs"""
13953,"I'll try it!


I drive a lot for work, so I'll give just about anything a listen."
13954,Exactly! Even the grim stories seem happy.
13955,"I'll def check them out!
  
I'm a chemist by trade, but any podcast that is geared more towards the topic (i.e. taking science as it is, not what the average listener will get) is absolutely my jam
  
I know that's why Physics Frontiers is almost aggressively unpopular...but it's like jazz! 
  
Sometimes you just want to experience people who are at the top of their field practicing their craft. Not just sanding the hard parts off for the lowest common denominator. Frontline or Nova instead of the Big Bang Theory.
  
End of rambling - thanks again for the tip!"
13956,Thanks!
13957,This is how I imagine Robert Evans would troll me
13958,The guest host episodes are rarely good.  They just don't have the dame story telling and timing Robert has. :/ Margaret Killjoy can hang with him pretty well and I've been meaning to catch her podcast about Cool People who do cool stuff.
13959,"I think Jamie Loftus should just take up a permanent residency on the show. I love it when she comes around, they work really well together."
13960,Idk. He could be ADHD or have anxiety. They manifest in similar ways.
13961,You know I never really realized but Jesus Christ goddamn he is so very very autistic :D
13962,"Sophie hates it when I do this, don't you Sophie?"
13963,Except for *bleep* who have an island dedicated to hunting and slaughtering thousands of children.
13964,You really can't know that for sure...

13966,Ol Hitler hands!!
13967,"It's a reference to the shitacular writing in Ben Shapiro's novel True Allegiance. The main protagonist is combat general Brett Hawthorne, 6'3"" 215 and a bear of a man.

And as a 6'3"" 225ish guy, let me tell you two things... I am not a bear of a man, and Trump definitely weighs much, much more than just 15 pounds more than me."
13968,Based on his voice I imagined he looked somewhat like John Green.
13969,L Ron reminds me of Trump in that they were grifters moving from grift to grift. L Ron landed on religion as the ultimate grift while Trump decided becoming president was his ultimate grift.
13970,It's a darkly humorous show
13971,And stay away from the dog park!
13972,">Have you checked out their book that goes along side the podcast, ""You Feel it Just Below the Ribs""? It's amazing and adds a lot of interesting details to the world it takes place in.

No! And I had completely forgotten about it lol. Thank you! I was listening to all their podcasts as they came out back when I was just so super poor, and remember plugs for books and being interested but just couldn't even consider it at the time. Now I'm in a much better place and can easily afford it so I will probably order one very soon!"
13973,"I'm jealous that you're listening for the first time. It's hands down my favorite podcast. 

If it's not Mitchell's, get back in the truck!"
13974,I see. Music gets old for me real quick.
13975,Definitely recommend Find The Path. Rick is so good at setting the stage and providing thorough descriptions. I love the GCP but Rick is truly a step above Troy as a GM.
13976,I had a tough time with the Mummy's mask series. It just seemed a little to goody goody and cheery. I also like the banter and table talk of GCP (or at least the way it used to be) a little better.

13978,The patreon is the best $10 a month I'll ever spend. Been subbed for years now and it's still more than worth it.

13980,"Critical Role got me into the podcasts, and as awesome as it is, Dimension 20 just has a certain chaotic charm that makes it some of the most fun you can listen to. Maybe it's the short campaigns and themes, but Fantasy High had me hooked by the second episode (yes, *that* one)"
13981,"I love him but nah, I'm not even into TAZ past Balance. I did some D20 and I just...don't click with live game play"
13982,Its name has intrigued me but live game play is just not my bad. I can't even finish any TAZ after Balance
13983,"I'm a huge fan of Amnesty, but I haven't loved an arc since then. I should probably give Steeplechase a listen, though."
13984,"What is their arc 1 called ?

13985,"OK, THIS is epic."
13986,"I mean Stav is the better standup comedian but on the podcast his entire presence was just him laughing and saying, ""Hell yeah dude.""  I think Nick Mullen is way better at actually doing a podcast."

""Peter Jennings of ABC News ran a story showing how Mohamed Atta, the leader of the 911 terrorists saw a commercial for one of my books, bought my book and walked into a govenrment office in Florida to apply to a government program. He was asking for over $100,000 to help buy a plane that he said that he was going to use for passengers and crop dusting. HE WAS ELIGIBLE FOR THE MONEY. They did not give it to him because they thought the idea was too strange.

But here was a person that came over to this country plotting to kill thousands of U.S. citizens and he was eligible to get government money. If he was eligible, you should certainly be eligible too.""

Followed by a one sided softball interview of the Koch's explicitly designed to make them seem less evil. Then a few episodes after that they started having ads from the Koch's. 

Completely lost all credibility. Plus around that time they did a pointless episode about how the host doesn't like belts and can't understand that other people do. Like what the fuck."
14050,"Oh weird. I legit have no ads during their episodes. Haven't in well over a year. I know what you mean by internal ads as Beach Too Sandy and Odd Trails has them, but I get none for ATWWD. Scared to Death I get the sight pause where an ad should be (as the host says now time for our sponsor break), but it just continues on without an ad."
14051,that's very kind of you!
14052,Thank you for the content! Can't wait for next week's TNO.
14053,"He also fairly allows guests he clearly doesn't agree with the same openness, friendliness, and opportunity to speak their minds as one that he clearly agrees with. Which is why his podcast is here, down at the bottom, on Reddit. Interpret that how you like."
14054,Reddit is way too square and uptight to enjoy anything irreverant and silly like Legion of Skanks.
14055,"Lol I actually got banned from a sub immediately for commenting in Rogan's sub.

My comment? ""You're fucking delusional"". It was like the Donald bans all over again lol."
14056,"I missed the final show/party at the Pacquiao Palace because my wife was pregnant and 2 days from a c section. So I couldn't be 85 miles away, likely drinking. Seriously though, between the written sketches, the random celeb interviews like John DiMaggio, Jeff Ross and Steve Rannazzisi, the random musings of the boys, and everything else, it really was a perfect podcast. It actually has a ton of relistenability."
14057,"All I'm saying is his podcast got a lot worse when he started spending between 20 and 50% of his show complaining about Trump. I'm not saying Trump is great or anything of the sort, but, I am saying I didn't enjoy listening to Sam bitch non stop about the man.

Edit - and I think I made that decently clear in my initial comment as well. Looks like you suffer from a bit of TDS yourself since you launched onto a little rent about him unprompted. It's totally fine to not like Trump AND not enjoy hearing other people rant about him over and over and over and over and over again."

14061,i respect Theo because he really seems to work on himself too.
14062,"So I made my Fiance watch it with me like 45 mins after I read this lmao. I LOVE IT but we havent seen Santino yet (we're watching episodes 3/4 tonight, and I know he's in 4!) 


Ive been a Tigerbelly fan for a LONG time, and Ive always admired the relationship between he and Khalyla. Its not perfect but they made it work. I admired the commitment they seemed to have. There was alot of crap about a year, year and a half ago about some sketchy things, and Brendan Schaub felt like he needed to pile on or whatever, and it showed across all three pods that they do. 

I think Schaub is a real prick, anyway. Only around because Rogan made him seem funny. Anyway, it just marked a crappy turn for the pod and I had to tune out. It actually marked a solid turn away from comedy podcasts/shows all together, because I stopped listening to Carolla too. 

I'll honestly most likely go back and give it a chance, now. I do miss crushing on Annie lol. Thanks for the push!"
14063,Praise RA!
14064,Well he certainly is not helping in promoting it then

14068,"I'd say the real idiots are actually the people who gargled up the media slander towards Joe and have deemed thousands of episodes garbage without having watched a single one.

People who watch know that Joe is an idiot, and Joe himself knows that. It's the people he interviews that make the podcast interesting from time to time. Some guests definitely aren't worth listening to, but plenty of very smart and interesting people have been on to talk about really interesting things"
14069,you are allowed to take the mask off now
14070,"11M listeners per episode and still the most listened to podcast worldwide. But because he had Alex Jones on the show y'all completely write him off. Let me ask, have you ever listened to any of his podcasts all the way through? Any comedians he's hosted, scientists, or adventurer's? Or do you just think he's a right wing nut because that's what reddit told you to think?"
14071,"Jethro (despite the name)  has clearly been indoctrinated by the far left.  Only farbleft radicals have this much animosity for Rogan.  The same Rogan who dmsupported Bernie Sanders lol.

The left has no consistency.  They make no sense mse anymore"
14072,He is pretty good at interviewing people though.
14073,I actually like Rogan. He definitely knows what he's doing. I just often like the person sitting across the table from him more.
14074,"Yeah, there's no overlap at all between Trumpers and Joe Rogan fans.  /s"
14075,"I love Joe, but I thought it was irresponsible of him to advocate for monoclonal antibodies *instead* of the vaccine, at a time when there was a national shortage, where they were being reserved for critically ill patients. Also, they cost hundreds of times more. Instead of giving that nuanced criticism though, the media smeared him for taking ""horse medicine"" and photoshopped him to look sickly. Bad look for all involved."

Only the purely idiotic would claim something like that."
14078,"Super helpful, thanks for letting us know!"
14079,"It used to be a really good comedy podcast, like, when he would have comedians on they would be funny and tell crazy stories and fuck around. Now, with comedian guests, he seems to just talk about the comedy industry, politics, and rarely engages in back and forth banter when a comic makes a joke/tries to riff. 

He reiterates himself ad nauseam too much that I won't bother with most episodes. Lots of good interviews with super interesting people over the course of the pod though."
14080,I don't have an interest in that whole marketing campaign.

14082,"LOL. There aren't any Left-wing ideals that are mainstream in the USA. The most ""Left wing"" people in the Federal government are Bernie & AOC, both of whom are barely left of center."
14083,The lack of self awareness in this comment literally made me do a spit take.
14084,Are you taking a piss?
14085,">Or ""that comedian used to be funnier before"".

Uh, yeah, they were. He was. 

Unless you're arguing ""*thing got worse*"" isn't possible, I'm not sure what your point is. 

I was never a diehard fan. But I wasn't actively turned off by any of his content. It was fine. He was funny and had some interesting guests.

If you genuinely can't see the clear shift in the podcast over the past few years, I can't imagine you were following him a decade ago."
14086,"I think the projection that ""woke culture"" is getting in the way of comedians wanting to say what they want is ridiculous. I've been to comedy clubs; the good ones are still good. Only the washed up ones talk about cancel culture. Hence Roseanne Barr being an opening act for Rogan's place."
14087,Classic response dawg. Like you don't critique things? You're a pick and choosing hypocrite.
14088,"I always listen to the Parks episodes. Those are fun. Funny is subjective though, not funny to you, but he is a very successful stand up comedian. Its how he started his career, so lots of ppl do think he is funny. But ya some jokes definitely go over his head. Mark Normand is hilarious."
14089,Yea i dont find his comedy funny either but i feel that in a world where everyone takes hard stances on every subject hes still willing to change his mind and bring people on with differing opinions. I also think the change that has come in the show is more of a result of him understanding how powerful his platform is now whereas before it may not have been as evident.
14090,"So you dont like him because he platforms people you dont like? Soo much for being tolerant and having an open mind. Democracy and democratic values are built on the foundation of tolerance, being open minded and allowing all voices to be heard. What you are espousing goes against democratic values. If you are ok with that and you rather have a one way discussion on all topics then you have every right to hold that belief and more power to you. However that would make you no better than Alex Jones."
14091,You're such a dork lmao.
14092,So why do you hate him? Other than the fact that you somehow think people who breath from their mouth due to health issues are beneath you. Talk about having a superiority complex.
14093,I love how you called out their bullshit and provided an example why it's not true and you just get down voted for that. Rogan fans are fucking annoying
14094,How does Joe Rogan know it's misinformation? Is he supposed to be an expert?
14095,"The Robert Malone who owns several MRNA patents?  How the hell is Joe supposed to argue with the man.  He asks questions, scientist gives answers."
14096,"Reddit is filled with contrarians unless it comes to Star Wars, Marvel, and Legos."
14097,"I don't think he's particularly open minded anymore, that's the problem.

Covid, politics and hoarding wealth has absolutely done him in.

Still occasionally great when the right guest hits."
14098,"No, a blindly anti-government partisan that lets bad faith actors use his platform as a way to spread their partisan misinformation. 

Letting someone with an opposing view to the cultural norm, such as Jordan Petersson and Ben Shapiro, is awesome and great. Letting on quacks who abuse their authority in their field for personal gain such as Robert Malone during an international Crisis that has caused millions of death is not being open minded, it's blind hatred for the establishment. 

The saying ""don't let your mind be so open your brain falls out"" comes to mind."
14099,"lol? what? I was mostly referring to his demeanor. he has a way, in his interviews, of giving off a sense of confidence that he knows more about the subject than the expert. I don't particularly like that. It has nothing to do with his political beliefs (not even sure what they are) just the way he does things. 

to fill in my blank, he is so overconfident.  

I feel bad for you if you automatically assume everything is political or a personal attack."
14100,I think he was going to say a dipshit
14101,"nope. I don't use political beliefs against or on creators. I think there is ground for every belief, and reason behind why they believe it."
14102,Huh. It was something I had heard somewhere before I ever listened to a JRE episode. It was some MMA fighter after a match IIRC.

14114,There is a season 2?!
14115,"This is so true and not just Rogan but all the comedy podcasts have this problem. 

2 professional comedians who are near the top of the game discussing what it's like to be a top comedian with a podcast is fucking boring and it seems to be about 50% of the content these days."
14116,">	They seem to be few and far between now.

I'd say that is to be expected. The people you mention are usually intelligent people who probably don't want to be too closely associated with Joe Rogan these days, and share the platform with people of ill repute like Musk and Peterson."
14117,Wtf why does every mild criticism of jre (or even just negative opinion) get this response. Is it that hard to believe that some people used to watch but now don't?
14118,But he doesn't agree with all the liberal talking points there for they consider him alt right.

14120,Talking about losing the plot and you're not even living in the same reality as the rest of the comments

14122,the comment does look edited to make it look sicker... so yes
14123,CNN? How far behind are you pal
14124,"I didn't say Rogan himself is anti-vax. I said the guests he has on his pod perpetuate anti-vax theories.

""Scratch a liberal..."" and all that."
14125,Yeah I guess if you only choose to look at the bad things Hitler did that's all you will see...
14126,"I mean, technically, you *do* have to sign up with an email address, but you don't have to pay to listen ."
14127,"Yeah but it's not the same, you have to load the Spotify app, which is a pain. Then the ads interrupt the flow of the Pod and minimise the video every time they pop up."
14128,"Funny how you sort by controversial, guess what's at the top?"
14129,"He said, on an upvoted comment about Joe Rogan. The persecution fetish is real lol."
14130,"Dude I bet they are. You're missing my point.  EVERY single JRE post has the same tag at the end.  We get it.  You feel oppressed.  It's your horse hair sweater.  Spotify paid him 200 million cause NO ONE LIKES HIM.  

Just say what you like and that's it.  Why does the persecution have to be part of it?  At what point are people downvoting not cause of the suggestion,  but because we're sick of 60% of the people here thinking they're a minority?  It's fucking annoying.  If you like joe Rogan's podcast just recommend it.  Why does the victim complex come hand in hand with the rec?"
14131,Gotcha. I liked Moe cause he reminds me of some dudes I've talked to before. No Agenda was so great during COVID for giving me references to use to calm people the fuck down and see reason.
14132,Chubby behemoth is well worth a mention too
14133,"I would say the conversation seemed more like he was just turning the camera on with the gang than a formal interview, I thought that's part of the magic, that's a lot of what other people lacked, while he wasn't a professional interviewer, he was still able to display those characteristics while maintaining the casual conversation and demeanor that he became known for. Perhaps I'm just reading into my podcasts too much, the newer episodes have been getting better but still feels miles away from where we were 2016 and before"
14134,"Reddit as a person would ride an antique bicycle and play a vintage steel guitar publicly posing as a busker while simultaneously being landlord. He'd carry a moleskinne notebook full of polaroids of him building houses in Africa, which he would pull out at every opportunity while speaking about Buddhism and the dangers of earthly possessions. 

He would only speak in ways that allowed him a tight knitting of syllables and obscure words that nobody knows, and his subjects will politely knod along as they try to think of a way out of the conversation they're being shoved into about 13th century German bread making.

Their favorite album is a collection of recordings of loud and annoying Eastern European cities where you can vaguely make out an argument between a father and a son occurring in Russian while drums playing in the background."
14135,So there is no valid criticism of the Joe Rogan show? everyone just hates it because it's popular? Come on just stop whining  echo chamber why doesn't everyone agree with meeeeeeereeeeee
14136,That sounds like the Joe Rogan bubble TBH.

14140,I understand we may have different views on certain subjects but please don't treat me like I'm an idiot if I disagree.
14141,"He's got a new spin-off-ish-thing of the show that doesn't play the screeching noise in the first second after the content warning (cats are grateful) and also doesn't contain any robot rave music. I like it a little bit better than the original purely because it isn't as jarring, volume-wise, but it does not have any 911 call or police interview audio. I find both of those things to be fascinating when learning about a case, so I do miss their inclusion. But TBF it is meant to listen to while gearing down, so it does seem well-designed for the intended purpose."
14142,"Check out r/morbidforbadpeople for more info on all of their shenanigans. They aren't good people, I used to be a fan and it's incredibly disappointing"
14143,"Same here. As an old H3 watcher since Vape Naysh/iDubbbz days, I find Ethan hilarious. I didn't like the podcast when it first started and I stopped watching H3, it felt awkward, but with the crew he has, I started watching it again and I find it hilarious. The guests are also generally awesome."
14144,"Yeah that clip is demonstrative of his humor more so than anything, that clip is just spread around alphamale tiktok where they took it literally."
14145,"He literally said that as a joke and has extensively talked about how he personally exercises and is losing weight.

Don't believe every gym bro tik tok you see"
14146,Honestly it's gotten pretty dumb and has been pretty dumb for the last 5 years or so
14147,"I refer to that version of him as ""Shadow Peterson"" because it's so different to his other persona that I honeslty think it's his shadow controling him."
14148,I'm sure he is

14150,"He's debated a bunch of people that are ""on his level"" and people I'm sure you would say are ""above his level"""
14151,"I haven't listened to him since he moved to Spotify mainly just out of laziness and I only ever tuned into the scientist/history guests. I don't think Reddit even understands what his podcast was. It was very much most of the time just two people having a conversation, it wasn't a scripted propaganda machine like they think it was, they act like he had an Alex Jones type show or something."

14161,"I started History of Rome when I was in rehab. Mike kept me sane during those first sober days and nights. I'm forever in his debt for helping me through that period of my life.
I'm still sober and I've listened to HoR multiple times since then."
14162,I also started listening to History of Rome while going through a rough breakup. He is very soothing.
14163,Your ex left during COVID? What a shit
14164,"> by all accounts he's not very good

14167,"Aside from the fact it's his later work which means he has the style more down and it's more polished, I find he is vigorously into the topic"
14168,"It's a matter of preference.

Since Revolutions deals with much smaller time periods (considering THoR covers, well, the entire history of the eastern Roman Empire) it can get a lot more in depth. There are also better sources since the subjects are more recent. 

I think THoR is as good as it possibly could be, given the sources available and scope of the project. Revolutions might be too, but it has a lot more to work with."
14169,"I'm early in the French Revolution right now. I think my single favorite part so far was discussing the end of the English Civil Wars. Was it a revolution if it ended with the restoration of the monarchy? If they hadn't decided to after 20 years, the English Revolution would have been world changing."
14170,"Revolutions gave me such an appreciation for Simon Bolivar. That is a man not discussed nearly enough. Definitely a lot to criticize, but he did something truly titanic and I had do little understanding of it before that phase of the podcast"
14171,"Thats the purpose of the 15 second intro though, you just press skip until you hit the fanfare. He even mentions in Russia how advertisers no longer supported it as he purposely made it easy to skip, unlike some other podcasts where they put ads in throughout the show where it is harder to skip."
14172,"I agree but there's a middle point between droning and raising your voice. I suppose it's down to personal preference, it's just that people always say they like his voice in particular when for me it's the opposite, I enjoy the content more than the voice in this case."
14173,Yeah you're definitely right.
14174,"What I like about *History of Byzantium* is that Robin really engages with the sources - he tells us about the limitations, the strengths, the biases, etc. He also goes in depth into the daily life of the average person in certain critical areas at critical times. I think that Mike Duncan is a more...charismatic? narrator. His dry humor really makes his stuff entertaining. In both *History of Rome* and *Revolutions*, he makes casual reference to the historical sources, but in the interests of keeping a smooth narrative he doesn't dissect them to the same level as Robin.

Both are fantastic podcasters, just with different styles."
14175,Just got to finish listening to The History of Rome...again. Guess I have the next six+ months of commute listening figured out.
14176,"I really appreciated learning so much about different countries' histories that I was never taught in school.

Like the Hatian revolution. How was I *never* taught about the only successful full scale slave revolution of an entire nation?"
14177,"I did 1848, South America, English, American, French, 1830, Paris Commune, Russia part 1, Mexico, Russia part 2, Haiti. 

I am a bit autistic so I started with what I thought was the most conservative revolution and finished on the most extreme revolution. That made more sense in my brain than watching them chronologically."
14178,"His were some of the earlier podcasts of this type that I got in to.  It did take a while to get used to the idea that this wasn't going to be radio or an audiobook in terms of scripting, vocal delivery and so forth. I don't know if that's the problem you're having but I came to quite enjoy his style eventually, for the sake of it."
14179,Carlin is fucking amazing but doesn't put out enough stuff for some reason.
14180,"That's his other podcast Revolutions. It's also very good, maybe even better. [Here](https://pca.st/historyrome) is The History of Rome."
14181,"Love that, I only heard it fairly recently. Was it the 9/11 episode?"
14182,It's not. Engineering disasters would happen in any system. They tie everything to capitalism even when economics is not the main cause. It gets tiring.

14217,">Which is exactly what we want out of them.

I think one of the things I love about the show is the same thing I liked about Old Topgear:  
Yes, it is a show that technically has a focus, but a lot of it is also 3 dipshit friends that have great chemistry fucking around with each other."
14218,"Agreed. 

Maybe if I started from ep 1 it'd be better but I don't really want to have to do that just to be able to even *understand* a (supposedly) stand alone episode. 

Oh well, not for me. I can see how it would be entertaining for those who are in on the jokes/like that format, and ngl I'm envious lol"
14219,"Yeah I gave up lmao. Looking at the comments under the ep it seemed like those inside jokes etc was going to continue for a while, and from the time stamps they didn't even really get into the subject properly until a couple of ***hours*** in. Also, the stuff I did listen to I found to be kind of overwhelming. 

There were too many people talking over each other and I got the impression they didn't really speak plainly, and so I had to be up to speed on a crap tonne of random trivia just to understand even half of the throwaway comments that were made. I'm sure if I went back to the very first ep then I'd be alright, but I kind of don't like that I would have to do that just to be able to understand what the hell they're talking about (in a supposedly stand alone ep)

I'm not trying to rag on it, and I'm sure it is a very entertaining podcast once you're in on all the jokes ect. I just do not have the energy at bother with all that lol"
14220,"That's fair. I guess some people listen to podcasts as kind of background music, in which case I can understand not wanting to listen to something that's information-dense."
14221,"I'm Dutch. I've never even been in the US, much less Philadelphia itself. And even I was offended af that attempt at a cheesesteak. Good god. It deserves its own episode."

14223,[deleted]
14224,Its not normal for podcasts. Its a little more important for WTYP because occassionally there are pictures that are impossible to fully describe because its all unrecognizable rubble. Words cant really do it justice. Because they have that component they also occassionally take advantage of it and write on it to describe which portion of the slide they are talking about which is mildly but not totally confusing if you are in a car or something and cant look at the slides.
14225,And no need to read Anna Karenina anymore!
14226,"Or dead, depending on which host you ask"
14227,"Yep, when they announced that it was very bittersweet because while I'm incredibly happy for her and her husband, she's one of the best parts of the show.

Then again, I always say that, and then I'm like ""is there really a *best* on the show? James is amazing, Andy is amazing, Dan is amazing, Anna is amazing. They're just a perfect set of people for what they do"
14228,"Due to the format you can jump in just about anywhere though the first hundred episodes are a bit rougher. Honestly, I'd recommend starting about 6 episodes back before Anna took maternity leave just so you can get a feel for the standard foursome and work backwards or forwards as you please. Every episode is pretty self contained apart from the occasional reference."
14229,"Oh, you're probably right. I haven't listened to a lot and what I have listened to was always while doing something else with it as background noise so I did get annoyed sometimes because I assumed they were faking their reactions lol

Thanks"
14230,"Oh, that's weird! I always assumed each of them found their fact for the week, then they all share all four facts to do their research. Then, the others might not know the facts each of them did in their solo research, so that's where the surprise comes from. Do you remember which episode they said they did it how you remember?"
14231,"They've been all over the place with those lately.

I remember when the XL episodes would always be a couple days after the regular episode. Now they can be months afterwards. Sometimes they air before the regular episodes just to mess with you."
14232,">  it's also really fun to hear from the occasional guests.

Rhys Darby was one of my favs, what is funny is I knew his voice from Bob's Burgers."

The guests are good though, it's fine doing it this way for a while"
14234,"> The basic premise of taking risk to get ahead from Rich Dad Poor Dad is something I took away from reading it 20 years ago. That has served me well. That said, I am not surprised that so many of his people end up in financial trouble.

I read this about twenty years ago as well - all I really remembered was ""make more than you earn"" and ""take some risks while you can afford to"". It's wild how moderated my view of the book became over time - he straight up advises getting into MLMs and avoiding mutual funds. He makes extreme claims about his success rate from investing seminars and claims if you're not going to 3-4 per year then you don't have the right grindset. Nevermind that he mostly made money from investing seminars lol"
14235,"The guy became rich by selling books on how to get rich. He was not successful in any of the ideas he proposes. 

If that isn't enough to completely discredit him I'm not sure what is."
14236,"It's directionally correct in terms of how to think about money. It's a good starting place for beginners looking to be in control of their finances. Ideas like ""invest money"" aren't revolutionary but many people don't think in those terms."
14237,"Meh, the book was a fun read with still some good and accurate information in it. I don't regret reading it."
14238,"I really liked it risk wise (the investing book specifically) but found it hypocritical and also waaaaaay too much fluff ""this was all because im awesome and not because i joined an MLM early and got lucky btw join too"" 

Trust my bullshit fluff probably like 75% 

And he shoves it into the next books too so you kinda keep buying the same thing over and over in portions 

This is unlike my review of ""the way of the wolf"" by belfort where the fluff was jerking himself off verbally for 85% of it

Edit: and to spoil belforts the useful stuff is just him renaming psychology tricks to gaslight and hype yourself up (they work but i mean why do you have to learn it incorrectly from him?)"
14239,"lemme guess.... Amway?

14240,"My dad forced me to read that book a few months ago lol, thought it was ridiculous"
14241,Freaky
14242,"> data instead of intuition

It's a mark of how poorly educated most people are about science that they think these two things stand in opposition. I've only ever seen one person speak cogently on that topic, and that was Richard Feynman and that dude's been dead for 35 years now. 

And it lets people like Levitt and Dubner get away with that kind of poor argumentation."
14243,">The book's thesis is about using data instead of intuition

I agree that *Freakonomics* has a lot of problems, but my understanding is that it's thesis is more about applying (what Levitt takes to be) the perspective and methods used by academic economists to explore topics outside of the typical purview of economics. One of the things that so much of the criticism of the book has shown, however, is that there's a good reason that different sciences employ different perspectives and methods.

It's fine to think about cheating in terms of economic incentives or crime in terms of market conditions, but it seems like Levitt had a handful of interesting ideas, only a couple of which he could defend with anything approaching rigor (which is only to say that he could sustain a back and forth argument, not that he's right), but decided to publish a whole book instead (and later an even less rigorous blog)."
14244,Igon values
14245,You could easily be describing Malcom Gladwell also.
14246,"It doesn't even address the more foundational issue that it can be hard to know if your data is even correct to begin with. ""People lie but numbers don't"" is a good idea in theory, but the reality is that getting numbers at all can be an incredibly fraught business. And *then* you have to correctly interpret the numbers, something the book also gets wrong constantly."
14247,"I haven't read the book in ages, but I have recently seen the documentary.  I'm pretty sure that the baby names section of the doc says that names don't have that much impact on your future, but that your name can say a lot about your birth situation (class, race, etc).  The direction of the causation matters."
14248,I thought that was the whole point about that part of the book. That baby names have no real proven effect on the outcome of a person.
14249,"Yeah, I think it helps a lot if you're not looking for ""truth"" exactly, just interesting ideas, some possible connections, and new ways of thinking about things.  I feel that way about most pop sci -- interesting, fun to read, you will learn things, but also take it with a grain of salt."
14250,I'm a firm believer that what put Freakonomics on the map was the one good call that they made early on : The link between environmental exposure to lead on the 20th century and crime. We really have removed an enormity amount of lead exposure from people over the last 40 years and the crime rate has dropped through the floor....and even stayed low during tight times.  We used to be savage to each other with all the lead paint and leaded gas around us.
14251,">baby names influencing the outcomes of those kids being pretty much incorrect or unprovable

I thought it had been documented.  Is [this](https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2021/08/18/name-discrimination-jobs) type of thing not what freakonomics talked about?"
14252,"Ugh, that chapter was sooooo hard to push through. Pretty much ruined the book for me. Like the council of Elrond tedious."
14253,so like pop-science?
14254,[deleted]
14255,I feel like certain data were excluded for legit reasons that they can't go at length in the book.  The book would be very lengthy if they discuss every nuances and data in detail and no one would read it
14256,I just spend 15 minutes listening to it.  Got turned off by all the dumb college aged jokes they make that have no relevance to points made by the book.
14257,I must've listened to an off one because it was pretty short and didn't really delve into anything.
14258,"But.... that's just wrong. If you investigate society by making wild conclusions based on questionable data then your field of study is incredibly reckless! And many of the ideas included in the book deal with HUGELY consequential social and political topics: gun control, abortion, racism! If you're going to use your academic standing to sound off on these incredibly mighty topics it is vitally important that what you are saying is *true.*"
14259,"I listened to You're Wrong About from episode 1 and think very highly of Michael Hobbes, but...

He does a lot of research, but as a journalist does research - he's very vulnerable to confirmation bias. Find a topic you're already knowledgeable about and you will likely experience Gell-Mann Amnesia."
14260,The podcast overall is better than the book. They have the experts on the show talking about their own research rather than Dubner trying to translate it himself
14261,"> I'm immediately suspicious of a podcast calling out freaknomics and the numerous PHDs that run through that show as being any form of problem.

To be clear, the If Books Could Kill episode was calling out Freakonomics *the book*, not the Freakanomics podcast, correct?"
14262,"You're Wrong About is the OG and the best of all three podcasts! I desperately miss Michael and Sarah together, Mike spits facts and Sarah makes you empathetic to every party involved."

14267,"Oh man, and if you want some examples, simply read below.

People cannot figure out how to just be nice to fat people."
14268,"The whole point of their podcast is that the scientific consensus itself requires intense questioning and skepticism. On most episodes, there is a substantial debunking of why current metrics such as the BMI, around which scientific consenses (?) are built, are actually faulty at their core. Thus I would expect them to be outside the scientific consensus. Study after study shows that individuals have little control over their individual weight and that dieting doesn't work. Their whole point is individual fat people shouldn't be held responsible for systemic issues. Fat people deserve a right to be treated for their actual medical issues, not to be told to lose weight before anything else. Maintenance Phase just believes fat people deserve a right to exist and feel comfortable in their bodies, and studies should be questioned rigorously."
14269,"If a fat person arrives at an ER on fire with missing limbs, the first thing out of a doctor's mouth should not be a weight comment.

Conversely, if a fat person presents with symptoms like pain and shortness of breath, they should not be tut-tutted about their weight."
14270,"I think they just aren't equipped to with a knowledge base and ability to interpret scientific evidence/ data. Hate to gatekeep, but I don't like trusting people that are that far removed from the scientific community on these kinda topics"
14271,"TIL reading scientific studies and pointing out methodological flaws, or cautioning against drawing sweeping conclusions from a single study, or finding out that a published studying was in fact retracted, or discovering undisclosed conflicts of interest, is ""pseudoscience""."

14278,I won't judge someone out of the brief moment I see them as that's a snapshot and doesn't reflect their whole life. But fat acceptance to me is on par with smoker acceptance. I'm not going to encourage someone to lead a lifestyle that's unhealthy and carries health risks.
14279,Lmao
14280,From mrs. ADHD?
14281,Yeah the only real takeaway I had from that book was that you should have passive income lol. Great insight man. I did like the idea of not being dependent on a salary for survival though. But that's about the most I got out of it
14282,The secret to his wealth is this one book you need to read...

So he was saying the rich are unethical and immoral?  Seems about right to me.  I've never met a rich person who doesn't engage in that sort of behavior whenever it would benefit them.  I've never met a rich person who has what I would call high morals or ethics.  They're pretty much all unethical self-centered assholes.  And yeah, one good way to collect a bunch of money for yourself is to bend the rules and take, take, take, for yourself without regard for others."
14287,Does it have a number in the title?
14288,"To help you cope with this, ~~buy~~ read my book."
14289,"I feel like there was about 10% substance and 90% bullcrap. 

Could have been 30 pages of ""why to invest in things that build money"".  

Instead we got Rich dad and the other one that dissappeared halfway into chapter two."
14290,"Basic financial education is great and I agree he laid those out in simple, easy to understand terms.  You can explain that in a page or two, though.

The rest of his book is garbage for reasons I outlined in another comment."
14291,Bingo. That book was ***not*** written for the common person.
14292,What has changed in statistics since 2005? I was just going through my stat minor in 2022 and nothing jumps out to me as crazy personally
14293,"The main criticism is that the Freakanomics authors take one statistic and draw a conclusion from it, but that statistic is usually taken out of context and their analysis is devoid of nuance or any real-world consideration.

Their take on why crime went down in the 90s is a good example. It's a complex topic that experts in the field don't agree on any simple explanations, but Freakanomics attributes it to a couple of things, even claiming that half of the decline is due to availability of abortions based on a statistical correlation."
14294,"It's about the content of the book Freakanomics, not the podcast at all."
14295,"Yeah in one episode he disses ""Outdoor Recreation"" as a major, which  sure it sounds silly until you do any googling or thinking at all. Who do you want working for the Appalacian Trail? Who do you want looking at the tradeoffs of putting in new, accessible development into a park that might hurt the wildlife there? Who do you want studying camps and after school activities? Maybe you want someone who has a degree in that."
14296,Why is it that everyone ripping on freakonomics can't spell it
14297,Meant the other podcast I mentioned.
14298,Ha! I lived down the street from one of the PUAs and met 3 of the guys from the book.  Justice for Herbal! He is actually a really great guy. He's genuinely interesting and I always had fun talking to him (NOT about PUA stuff.)
14299,"The only ideological zealots are the dumbass conservatives and centrists that think this guy is smart and being genuine. All he does is take anecdotes lacking context to push his book's argument, which is just an agenda to keep his foundation funded. Some of his ""data"" in his book is just repeating his own bad studies.

All it takes is for someone that can think critically and evaluate arguments to see through his bullshit, maybe throw in a little bit of fact checking too. I'd recommend you listen to the podcast episode and give it a fair listen. If you take your ego out of the mix, you'll realize why this book is being criticized. Or coddle your mind and don't listen to viewpoints that don't validate your feelings. I don't care."
14300,Yeah. Plus less racism
14301,SO much. Including a lot of data issues.
14302,Idk but no one in this thread can spell it lmao
14303,Listen to the podcast. That book is terrible
14304,I mean that just is not true so I am not really sure what to say. They literally presented evidence and they are both incredibly successful so I am not sure what they have to be bitter about.

14316,"I think Wrath of the Khans is probably my favorite. People in this thread are commenting about realizing how little they learned in school about WWI when listening to Blueprint for Armageddon. But if you're from the United States, you learned practically nothing in school about the Mongols. 

If they were mentioned at all, it was only inasmuch as the Chinese built the Great Wall to keep them out. And even then, the only description of them is the classic trope of the violent barbarians posing a threat to ""civilized society."" You don't even realize that you're skipping over a society that literally conquered China and produced arguably the single most dominant fighting force in world history. A force that--if not for some unfortunate timing with deaths of Great Khans--very well may have literally leveled Jerusalem or conquered Western Europe. 

Even more, if you want to look at it from strictly ""Western societies"" -orientated curriculum, there's an argument to be made that the Mongols are the reason Western Europe rose to the levels it did. Without the Mongols terrorizing the Muslim world, the Middle East might be the more traditional seat of world power and culture.

Yet, we get nothing but a paragraph about the people the Chinese built a big wall to keep out."
14317,What is this episode called? I am not seeing it
14318,"I love it, but my vote is wrath of the khans. The Mongols were so fucking interesting"

14326,"The WWI series is called ""Blueprint for Armageddon"".  Dan initially puts his episodes out for free, then the older ones eventually get put in the ""please pay for this"" section which is likely where those episodes now are.  $3/episode if I am not mistaken.

14327,"The old episodes all stream for free on Apple Music (I assume they're on Spotify too, but I'm not sure).

14332,The series is called Blueprint for Armageddon. His older episodes aren't on the podcast app anymore. You can find them on streaming services for free though. Or you can buy the episodes from his website.
14333,"Okay since people seem confused. Blueprint for Armageddon is the name of his WWI series. 

I think he has made this one paid at this point so to access it you have to go to hardcore history.com and pay like 8 bucks for it or something. His newer episodes continue to be free but I think he charges for them after a certain amount of time. Hope this helps everyone."
14334,"??? Not sure if I'm missing some background here, but he operates on a kind of rolling schedule with his podcasts. After they reach a certain age, he makes them only available through his website for a fee. He doesn't run any ads or take any sponsorships, so its the only (and imo totally fairest) way he makes a living off these"

14340,"I grew up in Kansas. We spent over 6 weeks on cowboy history and about 3 days on WW2.

When I called that out to my teacher, she bascially said ""to be fair, that cowboy history stuff was several decades and WW2 was only about 5 years.""

Looking back, I knew she had a valid point, but I also got the feeling that she was seething about it herself, but didn't want to undermine the class learning environment too much."
14341,We got like half a period at the end of the year for the entire Vietnam war lol

Then roaring twenties, you read Gatsby in English class. Then depression, FDR did some stuff. Then the Nazis just kinda showed up and Japan attacked Pearl Harbor so the US had to go save the day. And then we decided that racism was wrong and fought with the Soviets for forty years. Okay go have a good summer."""
14346,"So true, and the post - WWII era is so interesting."
14347,"That's intended, if you teach the children too much about recent history they start to question values shared by those today. 

Easier to ask your teacher why the colonials this and that, then ask them why Ronald Reagan did what he did, we wouldve had the ""politicizing school"" issue, indoctrination!"
14348,"I think it's because teachers always fall behind their schedule so everyone is missing a different piece of history depending on what time period they were supposed to teach through.

If you had US History I (revolutionary war-WWI) and US History II (Post ww1-present) then odds are pretty good your teacher ran out of time for ww1, and your second teacher just assumed you learned it all and went straight for the roaring 20s"
14349,"Right haha You get to Vietnam and it's like they say ""it was complicated"". Then you get to college and learn about things like Mai Lai massacre and it's like what the fuck"
14350,"Same, high school in the early 00's here.  We didn't make it past WWII.

Which is terrible, since some of the most relevant parts of US history are the cold war and civil rights movement.  I don't know how they could skip it."
14351,That's cause our history books were still from 1950
14352,My only take away was the Germans were bad and we beat them twice. It took Dan Carlin to discover that wasn't the case for ww1 at all
14353,"From an American perspective, that's pretty much what you would need to know. It just didn't effect the US on any scale close to what it did to Europe."
14354,Huh. It's almost like they're trying to avoid what the US did in the Pacific at the end. Like dropping a giant weapon of mass destruction.
14355,"I think the challenge to US history of WWI is, what lesson was learned?

WWII, Nazis bad, nuclear bombs, and the Holocaust. Civil War, slavery bad. Vietnam, colonialism bad, draft bad, chemical warfare bad.

The primary lesson of WWI is probably that violence is stupid and often doesn't accomplish anything. But we really didn't learn that lesson so it's hard to teach that and then WWII."
14356,"What do you mean? We totally kicked ass. Just like in WW2, Germany bombed Pearl Harbor and we went over to Europe and made everyone in the country, especially Germans, suck our huge fucking cocks. They loved that shit. 

We saved the fucking world, the Germans were sucking our dicks, but they didn't have capitalism so Joe Biden created inflation and they forgot how big our dicks were so Hitler tried it again in WW2 and we fucked their shit up again. Fuck yeah, America.

I'm pretty sure I'm quoting my history textbook verbatim here."
14357,It didn't do much and it was a lot of complex shit that's hard to pare down. Double whammy for American education system.
14358,"I disagree. I think if you look at history classes in other countries, Germany is a fantastic example, so is UK, they are really great and comprehensive. Compare what students in those classes know to what we know and it's sort of embarrassing. 

I don't think many people would say you could stand up the US school system to most school systems in Europe and say it is comparable in terms of quality."
14359,"Yeah that's a good point, but the US wasn't involved in Mesopotamia or Hammurabi's code either, but I could tell you all kinds of shit about that. We spent forever on it."
14360,"100% true. To say that history is written by the victors is not just a witty aphorism. We all live with the *ideology* that is pumped into us in school.

In the UK, we are also taught only about the wars in which the UK had a 'good' role (or at least a role that could be described in a good way). We didn't learn fuck all about colonialism, the British occupation of India, the Boer wars and the conentration camps, the Opium wars, the British and French carving up of the Middle-East after the collapse of the Ottoman empire.

We focused on WWII and how we were the good guys and won the war. And how the Germans bombed the cities of the UK so cruelly. Of course no mention of the destruction of Dresden or the execution of surrendered prisoners at Dachau etc.

And the same with WWI, except it's a much more complicated and hard-to-relate-to narrative for kids, so we barely covered it. Just that Germans were bad and they used gas to kill our boys. Of course, no mention of the UK's heavy use of Chlorine, Phosgene and Mustard gas but there you go."
14361,">you could make the argument that the US was the bad guy in that war)

Is that even an argument? The Domino's weren't going to drop. And even if they were, so the fuck what. The US had no business going over there.

But I agree with your theory."
14362,"Also I honestly don't remember us talking about the fact that the US dropped a giant weapon of mass destruction on Japan. Or the fallout from that, who died and how many, etc."
14363,"No American history book teaches that the USA is the sole reason the Allies won.

Sort of silly to ignore their impact on the western front and the absolutely massive amount of supplies they sent the Soviet Union though"
14364,"Yeah, I lived in Kansas City for a long time and that's where the national world war I museum and memorial is. I went through it for the first time and was just freaking baffled at how much I learned. I was in my late twenties and it was just completely eye-opening I had no idea."
14365,As a non-Texan I'm baffled that Texan history is a thing lol. I remember spending a day or so on things like the Spanish-American war and the various Texas independence wars that I sort of vaguely remember and the Alamo and stuff.
14366,"I took world history in high school, but so so much of it was focused on ancient world history like Mesopotamia, Greece, Rome. And then it's like somehow we just skipped ahead to magna Carta, and then we skipped ahead again to world war II. Very disjointed."
14367,"I don't know who that is, so I guess that means I'm not a closet Tennessean lol"
14368,">""favorite""(??) war

This made me laugh. I get the dorkiness of having a favorite war, but it sounds very wrong to just read it."
14369,">19,000 deaths the first day 

I feel like my brain can't even comprehend this."
14370,">That and the Flu of 1918

We have a new pandemic now. This is old news"
14371,"""the war of northern agression"""
14372,I agree. I remember spending forever on reconstruction in every history class I took. It always felt very boring
14373,Is that like a playlist of episodes?
14374,"He doesn't keep his whole archive open for free on podcast feeds like most other podcasts, only the most recent ones episodes are freely available. The older series are only available through his website which you have to pay for. Its the only podcast I've ever paid for, and 10000% worth it, I honestly don't think I've ever had dollar for dollar better value from any kind of media than purchasing his WW1 series. He doesn't run any kinds of ads or sponsorships so its the main way he makes a living off these"
14375,https://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-50-55-blueprint-for-armageddon-series/
14376,"After a certain amount of time, they go behind a paywall. Those episodes are pretty old now.

Edit: It's only $14.99 for the series, though. I'd definitely say it's worth the price."
14377,"The series is titled ""Blueprint for Armageddon"", if that helps"
14378,"Yes, on PBS. Absolutely enthralling. Never realized that Woodrow Wilson was a racist piece of crap."
14379,Thank you!
14380,"Where history teachers are often accused of being too dry, I think Dan could validly be accused of being too wet."
14381,"Yeah. I had to go up there to pick up a car I bought, and we were right next to the museum, and decided to check it out. I was not prepared. 

Did you check out the VR experience there than Dan narrates?"
14382,I have never appreciated a comment more
14383,exactly what I heard in my head while I was reading that
14384,This guy gets it
14385,"You have to drink every time Dan says ""ageen"", and if he says ""meat grinder"" you have to finish your drink. If he compares something to Lord of the Rings, or brings up aliens, you have to do a shot."
14386,Hardcore History... with a spoon!
14387,"I bet Dan has some choice words for Russian leadership in this war. Like, on paper, they have everything they need to steamroll Ukraine, but they haven't. They still might, but man what a pyrrhic victory that would be."
14388,"The first time is always so jarring. Like, Dan's got quite a nice voice (obviously, he's been in radio for decades), so when he does his ""quote/unquote"" voice it can feel like a slap in the face if you're not paying attention"
14389,Yea his are the only podcasts I've paid for
14390,Is there a way i can pay for it and listen through apple podcasts? Or is it only on his website
14391,Just started to listen to Twilight this weekend. I'm about 3 hours in.
14392,"New addendum is damn good too.

Although that's sort of a duh at this point ain't it"
14393,Ironically I just listened to the addendum and not the hh stuff lol
14394,The new addendum had the funniest Twitter backlash where one person was mad that he called tribal histories 'dark'. Most polite twitter drama ever
14395,"Yeah, he singlehandedly changed my entire opinion on history as a subject. History is the story of humanity, specific dates shouldn't be the focus of history, the actual story of humanity is what matters and what we should be taught"
14396,Dutch bot broke
14397,"To be fair, that's kinda where you have to start for Cleopatra's political career as monarch to have context. She was a skilled leader guiding a relatively weak State with a very interested, much more powerful neighbor."
14398,"Ha ha, does he really? I've been using that anecdote for ages, I'm a bit embarrassed it's completely wrong!"
14399,Pretty much set up the Vietnam war as well.
14400,"Current day, all the SEA nations *absolutely* still remember.

The Japanese are not popular."
14401,There's so many parts where I had to stop listening and process what I heard. So much horror.
14402,"The story about the guy who got partially decapitated but lived to watch his wife and children be brutally killed by the Japanese soldiers. Then finally watching them throw his 6th month old baby in the air and ""catch"" it on a bayonet. One of the most horrifying and heartbreaking things I've ever heard.

Equally heartbreaking was the story about the kid who beat his mother to death and then the rest of his family. All because they thought capture by the Americans would be worse."
14403,I found a few that are on my list.
14404,I literally began and then graduated law school in the time it took him to finish Supernova in the East.
14405,"'Supernova in the East' is about Japan's involvement in WW2. The one about the development of the bomb is 'The Destroyer of Worlds,' the one about how the war actually reached a point where dropping nukes was a viable option was 'Logical Insanity'"
14406,"Oh I see, didn't realise they were paid for, I was checking free feeds. Thanks for the info"
14407,"I found them on the high seas originally, and liked it all so much I bought the entire catalog"
14408,"I think Ghosts of the Ostfront is my favorite series by him. 

No other piece of media has ever made me weep over the plights of awful people the way that one did. The horrors of the Eastern Front are just.... Indescribable."
14409,Are they not on YouTube anymore?
14410,"Do you have an example of something he has made up out of whole cloth? He thoroughly researches everything so when he says ""I'm not a historian..."" I take it to mean he maybe isn't as well researched on that topic as a historian in that field but based on his research he can make X assumption."
14411,"It grates on my soul :\ and I love how informative he is, but I cannot get past the voice ever."
14412,It does take a little to get used to it. The upside is that Danieli is an absolute treasure and if your a fan of Carlin they have a couple episodes together which are so amazing.
14413,He says in one of his episodes that people say it takes 20 minutes to get used to it. I quite like it
14414,"Having grown up the grandson of Italian immigrants in a town majority Italian, his accent sounds like home."
14415,"It's odd that I was the one getting downvoted for holding a centrist point of view, while the guy directly above me and the guy directly below me got upvoted lol. His use of quotes are always sourced and always at least strives for accuracy. He also pulls out the caveat that he is not a historian. If you're looking for an academic reconstruction of history, go read a book by ""proper"" historians. You're always going to get a trade-off on historical accuracy when you want to package it up in an entertaining way, and that also goes for things that are as interesting and complex as World War II."
14416,"This is actually a comment that I was looking for in this thread. I was always interested in getting into Hardcore History, but as the son of a historian I've been taught to be skeptical of popular history. Not making a judgement on him, but I need to read about what real historians think of his work."
14417,">""actual researchers

Are they doing anything specific that he isn't doing?"
14418,"It's more that he really doesn't care wheater he's getting it wrong or right as long as the story is good.

Like, if he says ""take this with a grain of salt"" then its 100% wrong. 

And when his tone is authoritative you still need to take it with a grain of salt and google his sources which will sometimes be decades old and plain wrong."
14419,Not sure why you got downvoted. This is exactly right.
14420,"The only ones who complain are askhistorian mods who hate everything, including themselves"
14421,And he only reminds the listener that he is NOT A HISTORIAN 100 times per episode.
14422,Care to share? Always happy to hear two sides to a story.
14423,"Duncan is super boring, and that's coming from someone who listened to the entire History of Rome podcast. It's just a lot of dates and events thrown at you, like a history text. Carlin attempts to explore the extremes of the human experience, and so dives much further into the military and the human aspects."
14424,"But not like... boomer cringe, you know?"
14425,"Some are out of date, missing new information, showcasing antiquated biases, etc. but can provide some value. Outdated and discredited are not the same thing."
14426,"Thanks for sharing the post, it was an informative read! Besides the sniper question, it seems most of of the criticism is on degree of emphasis and not going into specific instances in desired detail rather than factual accuracy. The timestamp quibble strikes me as unfair and pedantic. The poster is outraged he's 3 and 8 minutes late on a 20 hour narrative? I don't know the range of scholarly opinion on the sniper question to say whether the assertion they didn't exist is as ironclad as asserted. 

The lively debate of historians in the comments suggests Dan is within legitimate range of opinion with the general thrust that the Germans are overly ""stern"" and acting in ways that are out of date with accepted norms of the times to put it mildly."
14427,"Thank you! I have no issues with Dan, I get that he's a lot more entertaining than listening to academics but I don't see why it's controversial to say that ACTUAL HISTORIANS on Reddit (And YES THEY ARE VERIFIED AS BEING ACTUAL HISTORIANS ON THAT SUB), are more knowledgeable. I never said people shouldn't listen to Hardcore History, I said people should be more careful."
14428,may I suggest the history of Byzantium podcast which basically continues History of Rome and Byzantium and Friends which is more academic but equally fun.
14429,Yeah I love Dan but I agree 100% with what you said. I guess I was just rambling with my comment idk
14430,"What stories specifically? Every podcast I've heard, he gives multiple perspectives from multiple historians. 

What stories did you hear him tell, and how do you know it was fake?"
14431,"Same, but I guess that's an unpopular opinion on this thread"
14432,Do both
14433,Lmao
14434,Hope you had a good sleep and can rethink this opinion with a clear head.
14435,Do you think the sources Carlin quotes are less credible than reddit historians?
14436,"Yeah, but historians don't agree on the subjects he covers. In his King of Kings series, for instance, he quotes Herodotus a lot, but he emphasizes that ol H Dawg might be embellishing a bit for entertainment purposes or cultural bias and he goes on to mention what other historians think is true or not. That's what's nice about it. It feels like a conversation rather than one person saying, ""This is definitely and definitively what happened."" Nobody knows so he gives multiple perspectives."
14437,Okay?
14438,That's the one. It's harrowing but a really interesting series.
14439,"Ooh, interesting. Thanks!"
14440,"Mike Duncan definitely sanitizes the History of Rome. The primary sources talk about Roman Generals slaying dragons in Africa and the Gods (both Pagan and Christian) playing major roles in major historical events. 

Mike Duncan is an atheist and so he edits out the ""fun"" parts of ancient history in a sanitized discussion on cynical power politics.  Some people call this a ""No frills"" narrative but God damn it I like the frills."
14441,I started listening to the first season of Revolutions as the host seemed to pause after almost every sentence and once I noticed it it put me off. Would like to give another try though as everyone raves about it.
14442,That full version of the Haitian Declaration of Independence is something else
14443,I liked the French revolution cos of my masochism
14444,Yes! And I knew so little about it going in.
14445,"Oh god but the post-revolution history destroyed me though. How cruel to go from such a hopeful position to such terrible events, practically daisy chained from then to now."
14446,It was so good. A story I had no familiarity with and a batshit insane one at that. And just incredibly sad. Definitely the most edifying for me personally
14447,"I wouldn't recommend it to somebody who's annoyed by the general Chapo sense of humor, but it's really good.  Hour long episodes, lots of depth, and a very materialist perspective which I appreciate.  Chris is more serious than Matt but they both know what they're talking about and it's a good time."
14448,"Unfortunately, the audio troubes don't stop with the Punic wars. Just as Mike Duncan is wrapping up the Crisis of the Third Century, I was hit by the Crisis of Duncan's Computer Fan. God, that was so annoying. 

Mike Duncan doesn't get his audio issues fixed until Theodosius and he doesn't really get narrative story telling down pat until the French Revolution."
14449,Thanks for these suggestions. I'll give Ep. 19 a go and see if I can get into the show and the history this time.
14450,Hmm I wonder how I never encountered it before. / shrug he's great anyways
14451,"If you like Kaldellis, on a lark one day I picked up a copy of ""Cabinet of Byzantine Curiosities"". It's not exactly academic or heavy reading, but really interesting anecdotes."
14452,Teasing the French is one of the most sacred European traditions! 
14453,"I do think it is quite surface level, but in a good way. I don't think it's trying to tell people ""now you've listened to us speak for an hour, you're an expert."" Like someone else said, they generally cover the main or interesting bits which sort of provide a framework for further reading. 
Its more for entertainment rather than providing someone with a detailed level of knowledge"
14454,"I've probably listened to it at some point, feels like I've been subscribed to every major one in existence at one time or another haha.

I actually think the podcasts that History Hit puts out are generally quite excellent. Feels like the History Channel in its prime (not too scholarly but still serious about things). There's the main feed, Dan Snow's History Hit, but the specific ones are more interesting imo because they dig into some very niche topics. My favs are Gone Medieval, The Ancients, Not Just the Tudors, and Warfare."
14455,"My car is from 2005, so not really an option."
14456,It just doesn't sound the same :(
14457,I absolutely expected the duty free shops episode to be kinda boring and it turned out to be one of my favourites!
14458,I suggest the guerilla public service episode (can't recall the name) where the guy made his own sign to put over the highway.
14459,"This is how I approach any new podcast, in part for this reason, and in part because sometimes they may reference a previous episode, and I'll want to understand what they're talking about."
14460,"That's not the origin of the name.  It was a design podcast about the invisible stuff in the world that we all just ignore, it's just grown beyond that. Specifically, it's from this Buckminster Fuller quote: 

> Ninety-nine percent of who you are is invisible and untouchable."
14461,I was picturing like... Dangermouse or something. Idk. Maybe I'm the problem. I pictured Jad Abumrad from Radiolab as Jason Schwartzman for years as well until I saw a picture of him.
14462,"Yeah, I hear you. More natural speech is easier on the ears for me. 

Some people naturally have unusual speaking patterns. Probably not his fault he has such a punchable voice. 

Also I get tired of hearing about his kids and Casper mattresses or whatever"
14463,So many things in that book I'd never even considered but make perfect sense like the snow plow thing
14464,"Interesting. I just re-listened to the 10 minute episode, what did they get wrong?"
14465,"and IIRC the wife ends up dead and that's their last interaction ever.

I had a hunch he was setting up a multi-part romance arc with the terrorist/Cliven Bundy stand-in (Soledad Ramirez?) with Hawthorne playing the stereotypical scarred stoic hero. I still hope he gets a sequel out someday."
14466,The fact that this is better written than the entire fucking book lmao
14467,"You forgot that he's a, ""Bear of a man."""
14468,"If you were a columnist, I would subscribe to your paper."
14469,"HE'S IN TOO DEEP, PULL HIM ***THE FUCK OUT*** **NOW**!!!!"
14470,"""That's the line"" Ben thought, thoughtingly"
14471,Man oh man are you missing out. The podcast episodes where they read True Allegiance are amazing.
14472,
14473,What in the fucking fuck!! 
14474,They sure do.
14475,"Great contribution, well done."
14476,Just search Ben Shapiro. It's like 6 parts.
14477,Yard
14478,"How did Shaps describe him? ""He was built like a prisoner"" or something like that?"
14479,"He was 6'3"" and 215lbs, which is kind of skinny for, say, a light heavyweight MMA fighter.

Moreover Ben's obsession with describing every male character based on their height is incredibly amusing. He made a point to say that all the terrorists were short while all the good guys were over 6'."
14480,"Which is not that big of a person. I'm 6'2, a little tall, but definitely not extremely tall."
14481,And he called him the nword in his head
14482,"Awesome thank you, is the Steven seal one the same episode ? Cheers :)"
14483,"Said best with Robert and Billy Wayne, unfortunately."
14484,"*Yemeni wedding, that's the famous one where we hit the funeral for that wedding a few days later. Although, I'm sure we took out quite a few Afghan weddings too."
14485,#Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
14486,That knife middle missile belongs in Lake Superior alongside the nuke.
14487,What are you talking about?  They just build the missile. What the government blows up with it is none of their business.
14488,"LockMart actually does the knife missile, Raytheon just has a better sounding name."
14489,Not as blown away as the wedding/funeral/school it will definitely be fired at.
14490,Look up the R9X. It's a variant of the laser guided Hellfire missile that carries six 2m long blades that stick out of the side right before impact instead of carrying an explosive charge. Basically it's an effort to cut down on collateral damage when using drone strikes for assassination purposes.
14491,"One pump, one cream."
14492,"However, Doritos^TM ARE the dictators of the chip world."
14493,That's actually that episode's source material. It's pretty much just Robert Evans summarizing the book.
14494,Good to see someone else recommending this book
14495,"then check out Chaos by Tom O'neal, I view it as an unofficial sequel. A lot of the same characters show up doing their fuckery from another perspective."
14496,"Excellent book, so is The Brothers. A pair of evil assholes."
14497,"I really liked this book but it really, really takes a lot of info as a given without presenting evidence. Some sections have a lot of good evidence and info but I thought the section near the end about the JFK assination was borderline unhinged. It veered too closely into conspiracy theories."
14498,Love when I encounter these references and suggestions. Found Devil's Chessboard for free on online archives and am already engrossed.thank you.
14499,Behind The Bastards did a great series on the Dulles Brothers. Such monsters.
14500,The Dollop episode on Reagan is amazing as well.
14501,TL;DL?
14502,"McCain's catchphrase: ""dadddddyyyy"""
14503,"There is no such thing as a ""good"" (modern) Republican.

If they were good people, they wouldn't be Republican in the first place."
14504,The Phyllis Schlafly episode really seared the hatred of Evangelical Christians into me.
14505,I said the same thing after finishing the book Legacy of Ashes. The Dulles brothers are awful and the CIA is the epitome of mediocre and awful men failing upwards.
14506,Same with the school of the Americas episodes. Fucking brutal.
14507,[deleted]
14508,To learn about people like the Dulles Brothers and that entire shadow network of people is to truly understand why history has gone as it has.
14509,"Robert is a babe, I lowkey have a crush on him."
14510,And the hosts of The Dollop
14511,That's why it's a 6 parter! The FHKs really filled the space
14512,"That guest is Gareth Reynolds of the Dollop, which is the mother podcast to all the ""guy reads history to someone who doesn't know it"" podcasts.

He's possibly the funniest improviser on the planet right now. If you like that episode you will LOVE The Dollop. Robert is great, but Dave and Gareth are even better."
14513,"To quote John Oliver: ""champagne is reserved for three events: weddings,  new years,  and if and when Henry Kissinger dies"" 

I especially love the ""If and when"". Like it's not a certainty.  If anyone in the world sold his soul to the devil,  Kissinger is a possibility."
14514,"If ever there were a person on American soil who deserved to get launched the fuck off of it via circus cannon into the sea, it's Kissinger."
14515,He turns 100 in May. BUT....kinda be cool if he didn't yknow.
14516,"I've only ever heard his name referenced as someone bad. I literally have no idea who he is or what he did. I'd guess he's American but other than that, nothing. Maybe I should give it a listen"
14517,"Always hated Kissenger, but when telling people about him, it was always difficult to sum him up quickly and succinctly. Then the Kissinger episodes dropped and they called him ""The Forest Gump of War Crimes"" and that was just so perfect. It's what I've been calling him now."
14518,More than Hitchens? I gotta listen to this podcast...
14519,The American politician? Why do we hate him so much?
14520,"Care to elaborate?

Idk, from what I gather he's a Jewish man who was able to escape nazi Germany, used that opportunity to get multiple degrees from Harvard, is widely regarded as one of the best to do his job as secretary of state, a father,  married for 50 years....idk doesn't seem like if he was all that bad that I'd really have to go searching to find why"
14521,And Betty White is dead. The world is unjust
14522,I don't know man. I have pretty bad faith in humanity already. I'm not sure I can handle a podcast like this.
14523,I'm sorry about your friend. I don't even know her and I like her 100 times better than Henry Kissinger
14524,"So I've heard from other commenters, and let me reiterate: 

"
14525,Looks like he's playing blackout bingo for war crimes.
14526,That was my first podcast ever. Got me into the boys and I discovered BtB shortly after.
14527,Fair. But at this rate he will never retire or die. Just haunt us forever as his living self.
14528,"When Last Podcast On The Left covered Mengele, they had periodic palette cleansers when things got particularly dark: they would drop a note of trivia about the 90's sitcom Home Improvement

As a result I cannot separate the idea of Josef Mengele from the fact that the rough translation of the title of the show in Germany is ""Listen To Who Is Hammering"""
14529,Quick point of clarification: it wasn't hinting for sport. They used every part of the child.
14530,I wish Robert hadn't dropped this bit but I understand why he did.
14531,I do not understand how anyone who has listened to the podcast would have though Robert was being serious.
14532,"It wasn't said, but I'm speculating those clueless people were the BA legal team."
14533,"To be fair to Blue Apron, that's not totally correct.

You left out the part about them also being used as child prostitutes first."
14534,What's the company or name of the episode ffs
14535,"Did they have a major legal issue and have to deep six the worst year ever podcast? They've made reference to having some legal shit that I just assume is along these lines, and that podcast has been pretty dead for a while"
14536,I am looking forward to solving all of our problems by nuking the great lakes
14537,"He opens one of his early podcasts in his real accent, but I can't remember which episode. It is definitely twangy."
14538,Is real voice is the Boston/Australian being strangled from a few episodes ago
14539,He's from Oklahoma and North Texas isn't he? Probably has a little more yeehaw in his voice than he usually lets out.
14540,"He asked why iHeart doesn't pay guests, they started paying guests, he got busy made his own podcast and started working again, asked to come back when the person he asked was out of the country, said recently that he's been blacklisted by iHeart."
14541,It's been covered pretty thoroughly on the BtB sub but basically he wasn't happy about not getting paid. I think there's a little more nuance to it but it sounds like he has no plans on returning.
14542,Me too. She is fantastic. I keep forgetting to give that a listen. I already have ten pods on rotation.
14543,"Margaret and Garrison are two of my favourite guests, and together they are gold!"
14544,Its almost like we are two different people. So weird....
14545,Yes but we don't have the awesome cyber modifications yet.
14546,Yes. Very entertaining.
14547,"It's set about 50-60 years in the future, a few years after the nuking of Dallas."
14548,For now
14549,"I mean, that's his book too. He wrote more than one, and he's been working on a sequel to After the Revolution; which I second as a fantastic book"
14550,"Vice. Yes, that's his nonfiction. ATR is fiction."
14551,"Absolutely, just disappointed when I turn on an episode and its a dud of non co host response when there are so many episodes where theres constant back and forth."
14552,"I love that guy and his soundboard. He's one of my favorite guests, which kind of proves the concept."
14553,"What are you, a fucking tankie? Obsessed."
14554,Probably worked with them as a journalist. But yeah 400K is quite a bit from podcasts and journalists work for a person who rags on capitalism.
14555,Yeah that's really not what I expected though it does explain his stories of getting away with basically everything in the face of law enforcement
14556,The first pic I remember seeing of him was [this one where I think he looks like Rasputin](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/coolzonemedia/images/e/ee/Robert_Evans_IwriteOK_Twitter_Profile.png/revision/latest?cb=20210925221014). So that's the image I had in my head for months of listening.
14557,I am avoiding looking at his picture for some reason.  I guess scared it will make me like him less. Lol
14558,"Don't get me wrong - I don't find it offputting or offensive, I just think he has a bad delivery.  He laughs too hard at something mildly offensive, he spends too long trying to make something mildly funny a little funnier by dragging it out, he just kinda has an overall ""edgelord"" vibe."
14559,"He is also no where close to that level of a public figure. I mean 90% of his fans don't know what he looks like. And yea, he is both too far left, and too pro-gun to be a public lefty figure like that. Not just pro-gun, just generally his ex-libertarian views are still there to some extent. I would love something like ""Some More News"" from him though."
14560,"No, Robert is dangerous man, you don't understand. He's been sponsored by **Raytheon** for years, and is planning a cult in the mountains to overthrow the FDA. Dick pills are the least of his crimes, honestly dick pills rule. Dick pills don't hurt anybody, unlike those fucking great lakes. Death to the FDA!"
14561,"I haven't heard that, but shilling for Hims to improve your manliness on an episode about snake oil salesmen was pretty scummy."
14562,"And this was one head read himself, but even still, maybe he should have more control over his product??!?"
14563,OU they touch about that in podcast. Apparently Seal was mad about it because he didn't know this was in movie at premier.
14564,It's also the source for a lot of John Leguizamo's rage fuel surrounding Seagal. Funny if you've never heard it. He'll talk about it whenever anyone asks.
14565,"Unless ur dying like right now, before the next ad break, you got time"
14566,"I pretty much only listen to BtB as far as podcasts go (Robert Evans has a way of keeping me entertained), so I'll just pretend that's the only thing she's in :)"
14567,There are several.
14568,"He's been on thrice IIRC 

Rush Limbaugh (3/9+12/21)

Synanon (6/22+24/21)

Paul Schafer (10/26+28/21)"
14569,Panama canal
14570,"Ah, is it?  Well, then, YES, listen to that!"
14571,"I think they are mistaking behind the bastards with a similar podcast The Dollop which is amazing in its own right, episode 400 pt1-2."
14572,I mean you're allowed to have opinions but Margaret is great
14573,she seems so humorless.
14574,"It's not bizarre at all: some people get interested without knowing his politics, get a whiff of them, and then reflexively feel he must now be wrong without being able to explain how."
14575,"The Hitler YA girl one about Karl May misses a bunch of stuff and presents some stuff as extremly weird while being normal (at the time and today).

From the top of my head: 

Misses the impact of the movies about the books.

Presents it as weird that someone would write a book (series) about a place they have never been. Up until today that is normal and back then it was really rare for someone to fly to a place to write about. So many western books or books about oriental stuff where written by people who never visited their described regions. That is why writing is a creative exercise. Even him going east is not that special. Look up how many tarzan books are their. He even fought in WW1

Idk if he mentioned it, but their are some native american groups who like some of the hardcore fans as some german fans are so into it, that they learned the language of some group and are nearly the only one speaking it today

The dog whip hitler wore was also not that uncommon. Fashion back then was just weird. 

Idk if it was that episode, but the drug cocktail hitler got was also normal for the higher class. Mutliple monarchs got cocaine, morphium, opium and some other stuff quite often, sometimes daily.

Karl May himself was quite pacifistic. Before the first world war everyone got more and more militaristic, even in the every day life. 

He presents his ideas as if people today don't know how his lies. At least in germany it is known and their are many article and books about it."
14576,"The Irish Famine one cites a shit ton from Tim Pat Coogan who makes up his sources and incompletely discredited in Irish Historical circles. 

I stopped listening after that one. The guest Propaganda is terminally annoying and while I appreciate Irish pronunciations are hard, there was no effort in attempting to get pronunciations correct for certain places/names.

Someone did a gripe list when that was released and it didn't cover everything lol

https://www.reddit.com/r/behindthebastards/comments/u1vgyk/part_one_that_time_britain_did_a_genocide_in/i4f1xfd/"
14577,"a few have been mentioned maybe not when you made your comment but there's the Irish famine one that ha already been posted, his take on crypto was completely wrong saying things like when you send crypto there's no guarantee the transaction will go through, this is just false and I'm not even a crypto bro."
14578,What was wrong about the chris chan one? I didn't notice any issues.
14579,"The Chris chan one was where I parted ways with them and re evaluated. I had also come to find them a little too self assured and not willing to challenge their own assumptions. They have some significant blind spots. You can't just assume your ""team"" can do no wrong. I got fed up of most of my left leaning podcasts for the sneering tone and general hatefulness towards anyone on the Christian Conservative side of the world. Its not helping to Foster understanding."
14580,"Yes, he's very open and repetitive about saying that we should not take individual statements as gospel truth and that there are varying interpretations with supporting evidence but none are definitive for many of his claims."
14581,"When you're taking complex history that people have written hundreds of pages about in books and trying to boil that down into an hour and a half obviously things are going to get left out, some context dropped, and some things streamlined to fit the story in. 

It's pretty much guaranteed to happen unless your podcast is 8 hours long"
14582,"I think you're projecting his need to be taken seriously onto him though, I'd say the same thing about Jon Stewart.  Just because other people appeal to their false authority doesn't make them an authority or mean they are presenting themselves as authorities.  It's super clear when Jon Stewart wants to be taken seriously, he's sitting in front of congress advocating for 9/11 victims or veterans.  He's also clear, exhaustively so, that his shows are for entertainment and he isn't an expert on the things he interviews people about.

Behind the Bastards is no different.  It's mostly story time describing some person peppered with fake ads for Raytheon and ketamine, they go to great lengths not to present themselves as an authority on the people they discuss and often call out the slim and/or biased sources they have to use to put together a story."
14583,"Someone lower down said he seems majorly autistic and in my opinion like would explain the super dry, weirdly timed humor and also for some people finding it funny. Like I'm ADHD and I tend to prefer the humoral tones of other neurodiverse people because well i guess we are wired similarly lol. 

The old idea that autistic people aren't funny is bullshit, because get a bunch of people on the autism spectrum together and they scream laugh like crazy."
14584,"If you enjoy reading, I highly recommend the book"
14585,cool granny
14586,"> after Michael left, but it just hasn't been the same.

Not looking forward to this. Found the podcast late and started at the beginning. Trying not to rush through it. I just love their chemistry."
14587,"I started listening almost at the very beginning and really enjoyed it! There were a lot of events and people that I had been obsessed with in the past so it was refreshing to hear a new take. And then...I just stopped listening. I forget which episode it exactly was but it was during the pandemic and just the tone or topic or SOMETHING made me go ""umm not really feeling it anymore."" I'm almost glad I stopped listening since Michael left -- I did try here and there to listen to recent episodes and it's just not for me anymore. But the older episodes are really great!"
14588,Why did he leave? I'm not familiar with this podcast
14589,I stopped listening once he left. The ep where he came back and she basically used him as a sounding board so really frustrating
14590,"And occasionally US domestic policy, when The Poors get a bit too uppity"
14591,"You might like Class of 07 then! It's a comedy series about a 10 year reunion of an all girls catholic school that happens to coincide with the apocalypse. Super funny, realistically dark, and captures a wide range of emotions perfectly. It's been one of the best things I've seen and is definitely up there in my favorite disaster shows."
14592,Thanks!
14593,When Michael left it was like when my parents got divorced but worse because Michael and Sarah actually had something beautiful together
14594,That one really made me think.
14595,"You're missing out if you're not diving into the backlog. The episodes themselves are great, but they also keep referencing stories they've covered before."
14596,This how some people like the Star Wars prequels...
14597,"They're really good. I would recommend listening to the Human Trafficking, Cancel Culture, and Satanic Panic episodes in particular."
14598,Checkout r/maintenancephase as this is a topic of discussion often over there.
14599,"Yes, unfortunately. I really loved Mike on You're Wrong About but I cannot support MP for this reason. I believe everyone is worthy of respect, dignity, and loving themselves at any size, but healthy at any size is dangerously false rhetoric from a scientific perspective."
14600,"Yeah this oddity is entirely on me. I didn't even pick up on the name because the main character in Star Trek Discovery is a black woman named Michael Burnham, which perhaps is what caused the whole mistake to begin with. It's just weird."
14601,It always gets recommended to me by suburbanites. People who grew and up live in sterile environments like that find it a lot more shocking.
14602,"The problem IS who the target audience is, though. That's... my entire point. It's people who have never met folks like this; suburban folk and white *collar folk treating the aforementioned poor rural community like a fucking circus because they've never experienced a lifestyle like that, and they're gawking. The person who made the podcast and the target audience are the *exact problem I'm referring to*"
14603,"And I assure you John is not a ""once in a lifetime guy"". You just... probably don't meet a lot of them if you're the type of person who enjoyed this podcast"
14604,It doesn't grab me as much also. Still enjoy it tho. Hard to beat Mike and Aubrey.
14605,"Yeah, Anthony's ability to play those kinds of characters is genuinely a little disconcerting."
14606,Nice! I'll definitely be tuning in
14607,It's the episode 132.
14608,Thank you so much.
14609,"Thank you! That sounds like it. It was so sad, but they're not all that way. Some are just crazy circumstances that befall people or medical mysteries, etc."
14610,Scott is such a good host.
14611,"every once in a while, when really frustrated at work, I just find myself shouting 'MR ENOCH' in my head."
14612,I re-listen to them listening to Norm talking about them on his podcast like once a week.
14613,"Yeah it took me 18 months to do the back catalogue, I started when they first went on Bastards. It's 800 episodes and probably 2500 hours, adsd new episodes and that's 8 hours a day for a year. 

Hi owen/Harrison and all at IW, you are bad and you should feel bad."
14614,Do not skip project Camelot.
14615,"I can see that if it's about current affairs in some way, but I listen to most podcasts like they're any other show, start from the beginning.

Started The Dollop and The Villain Was Right (and a few others) near the start of covid and have only gotten ""current"" with one or two. It's kind of interesting hearing then-current events going on in the background via offhand comments. As long as I get through more than ~2 a week I'll catch up eventually."
14616,It's sure a lot easier to listen about Trump now that he's not president!
14617,I only listen to KF if it's about current events or shows. I don't care too much for the ones where they jump back like 15 years to 2004 or whatever.
14618,">depressing once you realize they were just parroting Alex the whole time

Interesting you say that, I had a roommate once who was this very strange mix of new age spiritualism and conservative shit headedness that I could never figure out. This was over a decade ago before Jones was in the news all the time. I started listening to Knowledge Fight and it all made sense, that dude must have been super into AJ. I would love to find that there's a database of AJ call-ins, because I guarantee my old roomie was calling into the show daily."
14619,Dreamy creamy.
14620,I'm not even into tennis but I love the passion and joy tennis brings Jordan. I do enjoy baseball so I get to love that with him. I love how excited he gets about things. We could all use that feeling. I guess that's my bright spot today.
14621,They don't.  Dan has routinely said that listening to that much Alex Jones takes a large toll on him.
14622,"Cutting back to that little was better for me, I agree.  However, I'm still a month or two behind on all my podcast subs.  I just need to drop a few to get caught back up.  These guys do good analysis, but I just don't need the evil they analyze in my life.

Because then I'm still occasionally, in my life, the only guy that mentions Alex Jones."
14623,Jar jar Binks has a Caribbean black accent
14624,It's time to pray.
14625,I renounce Jesus Christ!
14626,JAR JAR BINKS   Has a Caribbean black accent
14627,With sad human eyes
14628,"He definitely is. I re-listen to the project Camelot episodes a lot because that flavor of insane space bullshit tickles me, and the squatch guy threw in a LOT of references from their previous episodes. 

The major one for me that Dan didn't mention (although he played the clip of the squatch guy) is that the guy mentioned a ""benevolent AI"" overlord. He repeated it multiple times for Carrie to hammer it home. This is the phrase that Dan instructed Mark Richards to use when they were wondering if Mark listens to their podcast."
14629,"Sure, she literally admitted to it lmfao but yeah. Conan fake chuckles too, it's the business, they try and make the guest look good. Sona just used to do it way too much."
14630,Yeah same people downvoting this probably bitch about Jimmy Fallons fake laughing too lol
14631,"So good. Listening to it again now. So many good lines.

""As you know, the line between pleasure and uh, uh, pain is PAPYRUS-thin"". - Jeff   

""Insanity! Absolute insanity!"" Conan"
14632,Jeff goldblum is an incredibly fucking weird dude.
14633,Same with Conan and Kevin Nealon.
14634,"Timothy Olyphant is perfection. Incredibly attractive, hilariously funny."
14635,Sona has such a great laugh.
14636,Bet you can't wait to hear the new episode of Mall Walkin'
14637,The Chill Chums are the best. They need to make those longer.
14638,Fuckmans leap
14639,"Sona adds zero to the show. I'm not usually a hater, but she has no originality whatsoever. I find her super generic."
14640,"It's a favourite of mine, too, but I think Dana Carvey as Jimmy Stewart getting a blowjob is over the top for me. But there are sooooo many memorable moments and guests, and of course the bookended bits."
14641,Bill Harder definitely was amazing too. His laugh is absolutely contagious.
14642,"I enjoyed that one too, just listened to it like last week. Timothy olyphant returning was pretty good, dax shepard too"
14643,"Oooo, I haven't listened to that one yet. Add it to the list!"
14644,Bang on the money here. Genuinely unhinged material.
14645,"He said (in his first Conan interview maybe?) that originally he wanted to do stand-up. He tried it once and bombed, so then he went into acting. Thank God, because him as Raylan Givens is a masterpiece."
14646,Mulaney is from Chicago actually
14647,"The second ones have been fine, but I've generally preferred the first. I don't know, most of the second ones are years later when the guest has something to plug. I mean, the Olyphant one was 3 years apart, as was Goldblum and as was Franken. That seems pretty good."
14648,"Dana is amazing at riffing *with* Conan, but not even close by himself or with Spade. Conan always brings it home, and moves it forward."
14649,"I want Conan and Bill as partners on a special 3 hour episode of Murderville.  When Detective Terry Seattle sees them as his partners for the episode, he just leaves.  Then Conan and Bill have to figure it out on their own."
14650,"Even if you're not a fan of Bonanza, Matt's podcast **Bonanas for Bonanza** with Andy Daly and Maria Bamford is delightful."
14651,"Damn your opinion. 

I do agree with you, but Conan is definitely the most in your face if the bunch and to me it works having someone else with him who likes to butt in. If Matt weren't there I think Conan would more than fill in for matts talking time"
14652,"I don't know anything about Matt, other than from this podcast. It must be incredibly intimidating to even try being funny around Conan, and I really appreciate when he goes for it. Even if it fails or falls flat, which is something I've yet to hear Conan do. Seriously, I don't think Conan ever messes up in a non funny way in this podcast."
14653,"Obviously 20 days late to this thread, but I was linked to and happened to find this comment about an hour after listening to that episode. I literally had to pull over from laughing so hard after he said this quote."
14654,It was hilarious
14655,It worked and you could tell it wasn't a bit
14656,When he reveals what he was laughing at on the plane and they collectively lose it is so fucking funny.
14657,"Oh my god that part was incredible. I've never heard Bill laugh like that, and it was at his own story "
14658,"This is called ""being Canadian."""
14659,Your career is an inspiration to show just how far you can get with not that much talent
14660,"I saw a bunch of comments about a squirrel episode, so I downloaded that one for later!"
14661,Thank you!!
14662,"Cheers, I'll add it to my subscriptions"
14663,I have not. Chill out? Like how so?
14664,I just listened to this one the other day.  There was an extra bit of tension but I didn't think it was notable.  The whole 15 lines 15 clues thing felt like some bad Abbott and Costello bit.
14665,Worked with these guys for 6 years when the podcast was first developed. Josh can be an ass so this is not surprising.
14666,I just hate that half the time he sounds like he's done zero prep.
14667,"They do a good job of covering the topics and are really easy to listen to, but they're not experts in anything they talk about for the most part so it's not like they have the credentials to explain exactly how black holes work but you'll get the jist of how they work."
14668,You should definitely listen...it's not like incredibly in depth but it's fun...just like 2 guys chatting about a new topic they just learned...relaxed easy listening and you might learn a thing or 2 along the way....pick the episodes you are interested in first then go for other ones
14669,"The tone of the show is more that these two old buddies of yours just learned about this interesting topic and want to chat with you about it. They definitely don't present themselves as experts, and they make a lot of effort to source and verify (or discredit) the information they share.

You come for the thinly researched topic.

You stay for the banter."
14670,"If you want to hear about a subject and history often associated with it then yes listen but don't consider it a source of detailed technical knowledge on a subject, it's fun and informative but not instructional and often details are technically correct but not in context or complete is what my experience has been on topics I'm familiar with.

Also it's a very kid friendly podcast, both in how they try to communicate subjects in simple and fun manner but also without vulgar language very often. One of the better whole family podcasts in my opinion."
14671,"I am a fan. People are right, it's not in depth but it is enjoyable. 

Each podcast covers a random topic, from soil to what caused the last bronze age to collapse by way of how jet lag works and how enron fooled the world. 

It's two guys chatting. It's not deep but it's interesting hearing about things I would never look up and read about. 

I used to listen to them while jogging, how I tend to have them on when I am getting ready in the morning. 

My other listens are 

the rest is politics - uk politics with Labour PMs right hand man and a man who stood for conservative party leader (who would have become prime minister). Grown up politics that crosses party divides.

Another uk politics is the news agents - three established and respected political journalists discussing daily politics 

Those two are the two most listened to podcasts in the UK

The rest is history - a history podcast, again a British slant 

You're dead to me - another history one but a bit more humorous 

Infinite monkey page - popular science"
14672,"In my opinion it depends on what you want out of a podcast. I personally love learning, and after hearing how truly poorly researched they were in some topics I know well, it kinda turned me off of them as a whole, and they tend to stay pretty surface level in their coverage of a topic.

For me, it's not worth my time listening, but if you're looking for a brief overview of a topic (essentially them reading a Wikipedia page to you) you could enjoy it!"
14673,"They're entertaining, but they're also basically just reading the Wikipedia article to you."
14674,"Yeah definitely, if you're particularly interested in one of their topics, research it yourself. But it's a great source for a good grasp on a wide array of topics"
14675,"I've listened to the podcast as long as it has existed and I'd say it's alright, it's like skimming through Wikipedia it's not meant to be super informative just the most interesting/fun fact like stuff of each topic."
14676,"Yes. I've learned enough over the thousands of podcast episodes they've made where most of my friends regularly ask ""how do you know that"" and then they can answer it themselves ""stuff you should know"" 

They're also just two really cool nice and funny guys, highly recommend."
14677,Totally worth listening to.
14678,"It's literally a tldr for all of their subjects. On lots of things, they've only even known about the topic for a week or less. I love it because of their nerdy chemistry, but they aren't subject matter experts for anything, they are just normal guys talking about stuff. It's like a ""How Stuff Works"" podcast and lots of their info actually does come from ""How Stuff Works"". I DO like expert level knowledge podcasts, but I love SYSK and their non-expertise still."
14679,"Depends what you're really looking for. I think it's worth it although I've for the most part moved on to different podcasts (been on a behind the bastards kick the last few months). They've been making the show forever, they have great banter and I think it's cool to learn about some things I know absolutely nothing about, but take the facts with a grain of salt. It's a good jumping off point if you want to learn a little bit about random shit"
14680,"Saw bones is one of my personal favorites! I also love this podcast will kill you, it's even more research/biologically based!"
14681,"Sorry, replied to the wrong comment."
14682,"They're usually pretty good with being factual but they don't cover everything as thorough as possible. I've heard plenty of episodes where they've gone back and correct inaccuracies from past episodes. But they're not going to be as in-depth since the whole show is supposed to be super broad. 

I find their podcast super helpful for introducing interesting topics at a high level, and if I'm intrigued I just go off on my own to learn more from detailed sources."
14683,They are for the most part factually accurate tho
14684,"If somebody is listening to a 40 minute podcast with the goal to go build a bridge afterwards, I think that reflects more on them than it does the knowledge of the podcasters lol"
14685,"The whole show is facts and it's not as though they're largely wrong. A certain amount of errors are expected. I just noticed too many for me to be able to trust them as a default. I would keep listening and they would keep saying stuff that would nag at me, thinking of how many people are would be listening to it and taking it to be true--and how many errors I may have eaten up.

I looked up some of the last episodes I listened to. I seem to have stopped listening for good in September 2022.

One single example: ""How Wind Works"" (from a bit earlier in 2022) was stopped by me immediately after (around 10-11 minutes in, depending on your podcast service) it was confidently said, and agreed to, that the flight path of a plane on an in-flight map from Miami to Seattle is curved because of the coriolis effect and the plane needing to be aimed at where Seattle will be by the time it gets there.
If it *was* the coriolis effect, the deflection would be in the wrong direction. It is instead a result of converting a 3D sphere into a 2D map, where the shortest distance between two points on a sphere, over the surface of that sphere, is not usually a straight line when drawn on a 2D map."
14686,Estate tax
14687,"I did for years, then they talked about my expert topic and I never returned"
14688,"And /u/gingersnapsntea just said ""cremains!"" That means it's time for reader mail."
14689,Lol! So true.
14690,The episode about wine fraud is super fascinating
14691,Oh!  Their episode about the Black Panthers was really illuminating too!
14692,"I think it's because it's a ""how stuff works"" product. I don't think it's the two guys doing it as their own thing so companies gotta company and have 36281518 ads..."
14693,"I used to listen to them years ago, and they make great background noise if you just want something on. But to me, it quickly became apparent that they are basically just reading articles on a topic and don't really dive too deep into subjects. I realized that when they did a show on something I knew a lot about and they got a lot of things wrong. They're great for extremely surface level stuff on a broad range of topics, which is great, I listen to other podcasts like that. But they are definitely a filler podcast that gets replaced by anything else I want to listen to."
14694,You just have to hit FF a couple times tho lol. If I couldn't FF then yeah this would be a huge issue
14695,It could be an interesting idea to take the same approach and do it with a complete stranger from a completely different background as you.  Like a first generation immigrant from a retirement home.  It's a broad enough idea that I can't imagine anyone judging you for running with it if you really wanted to.
14696,I don't think I've ever heard them say anything worse than like damn. But I could be wrong!
14697,It's about a bunch of different stuff which you should actually know about
14698,I wrote an answer to this question up above.
14699,It was a reference to Modest Mouse dude/dudette/person. Get help bro!
14700,With a side of titanic sized rivets for good measure I hope
14701,Yes their chemistry is incredible! And any time Alice and James pile on Jamie is especially delightful.
14702,It's the children of the author reading and discussing the book.
14703,"No, it's much better than that! The 30-something son of this 60-something retired Northern Irishman reads his dad's erotic novel series aloud with his two friends. The charm of the podcast is the incredible dynamic between the three hosts and the absolute insanity of the erotic novel, *Belinda Blinked*, the story of the sexiest saleswoman in the pots and pans industry. It's very much worth giving it a go!"
14704,It should be added that the dad has no literary background. He just decided to write bad smut in his old age. It's hilariously bad and the hosts are lovey.
14705,"Thank you. This is all I was wondering.A lot of podcasts names don't describe exactly what their about. For example, The Moth isn't about literal moths."
14706,"Flint and Blue Bell made me so mad! At the end of Flint, Newark, NJ is mentioned. My boyfriend's mom lives there so I called him freaking out. They said her water is clean, but I still don't trust it. BB isn't sold in NJ, but it's sold down by my dad at the local Walmart in SC. Luckily he's cheap and says BB is too expensive. I have to listen to the octopus again. I tried earlier at work but kept getting distracted so I couldn't focus. 

The Tania Head episode makes me absolutely irate. I listened to it once and can't do it again. I grew up so close to the city I could see the Twin Towers from the 3rd floor of my grammar school. It's disgusting how anyone could take such a tragedy and use it for personal gain."

14736,">It's very monster of the week at first, but eventually shifts to being very main plot focused.

This is true. And the most amazing trick the show plays is that if you go back on a relisten, you realize it was actually **never** monster of the week and was *always* main plot focused. Every single episode moves the story forward meaningfully - just as a new listener, it takes you a long time to connect enough individual strands to see that it's all part of the same web.

It's the single tightest work of fiction I've ever seen...and you spend the entire first season without even realizing."

I wonder how their camping trip went, now that I think of it."

The fact that you followed up with that he's ""one of the sweetest people [you've] ever met"" is basically you saying that he's the exact opposite of what I consider someone who is a ""garbage human"" would be.

14795,"No, I'm not. The fact is in the season they put blame of the war solely upon South Korea/US and acted like the post-war North Korean government was innocent for the things it had done. I do want to clarify I'm not ""both-sides""-ing this,  the US led forces committed atrocities beyond what is reasonable in war which don't have equivalent to things done by the North/ China. Nor do any of the former or current sanctions and economic actions against the North serve to do anything but make innocents suffer (same can be said for those in place on Iran, Cuba). What I am saying is the hosts make it seem like North Korea was an exemplary country and would still be if it weren't for US action. I could not agree and the way the state is run should be avoided. I would describe myself as a social Democrat so maybe I'm just upsetting those who are more further left than my own views, or maybe I myself misinterpreted the points being made by the hosts"
14796,"> I find it far more plausible that both Americans and North Koreans committed atrocities rather than one or the other.

Do you ever think about why you may feel this way? What makes you just assume that North Korea *had to have* committed equal atrocities to the US and that this podcast failed to showcase them? Is it because of what you've heard your entire life about how bad and authoritarian and totalitarian and (gasp) *Marxist* North Korea is? Who shared that information with you? Do you believe what the nazis said about the soviet union? Do you believe what the confederacy said about the USA?   

>I myself am a leftist

It's strange a self proclaimed leftist would 'both sides' a real life situation where a far right imperialist invader brutally mass murdered leftists, set up a puppet far right wing dictatorship that continually mass murdered workers for decades and conducted what can be easily described as a genocidal war against the Korean people. I'm pretty curious what 'leftist' means to you, considering without any evidence you're certain that in a real life situation like the Korean War ""the left and the right both committed atrocities and are equally bad"""

Hell, Adam repeatedly talks about how he shit himself at a show, grabbed the turd with his hand, and threw it into a plant. 

The difference is in other comedian/comedic shows, they are ""friends"" *because* they are in the same business. TII crew are friends who *happen to work* in the same business.

14824,"Usually the beginning is banter for a bit between the host Scott and any of the more regular guests(who are kind of like co-hosts more than guests), typically like 10 minutes. If it's newer guests, then he'll introduce the first guest, talk to them about a project or they'll just riff depending on who it is. When the show takes a break, typically the guest will either stick around or they will ""leave"" and then they'll assume a character and rejoin the podcast as an improvised character after the break. 

A lot of the characters are reocurring and like a lot of long running podcasts, a lot of the jokes/bits won't make sense without context, but you should be able to tell if you'll like the podcast if you can find an episode with a guest you like where you can get a feel for the format and style of humor."
14825,"You probably want to pick one with guests you really like tbh to start with+. This was was decent from memory-#158 - Words with Friends (Gillian Jacobs, Jordan Peele).

14843,"Oh no, the only other person I've ever come across who has heard the episode hates it! D: 

Well, first off, I came in kinda expecting the chaos of HRR to take over the show so I wasn't surprised, I figured it would be a semi-canonical one-shot, since following a structure isn't really what they're known for. Like, they immediately establish that Champagne Champagne counts down from 10 every time she fires her crossbow, because they just can't not riff off each other, I knew it would be a ride. It just makes me laugh. It was a good palette cleanser after they had wrapped up a pretty big adventure an episode of two earlier, as I recall, so I welcomed the silliness before going back into another lore heavy storyline. I liked the callback and continuity to Riddle Guy, and it's obviously the natural concept for a crossover between the shows. I haven't listened to Sitcom D&D, though I've been meaning to, so I don't really know much about Erin's character there, but I loved the absurdity of the character and the unexpected emotional arc of no one ever having wished her a happy birthday back, and the entire crew somberly singing Happy Birthday to her as she dies. I didn't really perceive Adal trying to take over, as much as just being a guest star (and clearly the one out of the three with the most ability to keep things somewhat on track, so naturally he'll be the one speaking the most) and I laughed at all his dumb quips (like the bad guy telling them he's giving them a 5 minute head start, and him going ""you heard him, we got five minutes, start hitting!!""). I **loved** the final riddle being a callback to a really early HRR riddle that really stumped them bad, and I loved Albi getting to be badass and killing the guy.

I don't know. It just really hit all the right notes for me.

edit: And them all talking about how sexy Adal's insane pineapple-headed muscle guy is, and him *immediately* taking it too far and making them all turn on him when he says ""and his cum tastes *amazing*"" had me fucking rolling."

14892,"Yeah, I preferred a focus on more science-y things but it also lost its soul. It feels that they have lost touch with the pulse of everyday people. They aren't grounded in the human experience like they used to be."
14893,"It's weird, because I remember loving the first season of Invisbillia with Lulu hosting, but I'm not feeling it with her hosting Radiolab now."
14894,"That is by far the coolest, most interesting thesis topic I've ever heard."
14895,"Not OP, but, just listen to the intro, for starters. It's overly layered. You've got Lulu mock-singing or laughing loudly a lot, which isn't charming, and that's usually looped and/or mixed over some loud classical music, and then fade in the sound of a crowd or some construction clambering, and through the entire thing you have Latif speaking in short, choppy sentences or giggling at everything Lulu says (none of which is funny, at least, not for an adult). 

And, that's like 30-seconds of content right there. It just goes on like that. 

IMO, it sort of worked with Jad and Robert because *they* worked. Now, it's just a cacophony.

Edit: [I mean...](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL2ZlZWRzLndueWMub3JnL3JhZGlvbGFi/episode/OGQyNDVhNmYtYTc5ZC00NmE3LWE3ZDQtOGRiOGM0MDJkY2U5?ep=14)"
14896,"Good on ya! In the past five years I've gone from being a passionate home-brewer drinking several most nights to a moderate drinker to barely touching it now, like weeks between drinks without even thinking about it. Definitely feeling better for it too. Understanding what it does to your brain chemistry made me really appreciate why it shouldn't be a regular part of my life."
14897,"I need to give that one a listen. He offhandedly said in the episode on dopamine recently, that the correct definition of moderate drinking is about two drinks a week. As seriously as I take his advice, that has been turning over in my mind ever since."
14898,"Ya, funny thing about mottos....

He takes low-evidence studies and extrapolates them in ways that is completely inappropriate. He'll talk about some in vivo experiment and then make recommendations about taking a supplement or some other intervention, that is not how good medical science works. Here's one decent [thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/cogsci/comments/rwqr3p/without_doubting_his_credentials_is_andrew/), but it doesn't take much looking to find actual experts in the areas he covers picking him apart. The biggest problem is his gish gallop, he just unloads so much bullshit it's honestly damn near impossible for anyone to fully debunk."
14899,"I've listened to him since he started and the only actionable steps he has helped me with are very close to common sense - good nutrition, good sleep, exercise. Everyone has sponsors, it's painfully easy to ignore them and if people are impressionable that's not his problem. He's peddling basic lifestyle products, not awful things 

Edit: Also, I think you're underestimating the audience. The dumbest are the loudest, but I'm pretty sure 90% of listeners don't think everything he is discussing is indisputable fact, or even that these are all well-designed studies with results that can be applied to people so easily. But maybe I'm wrong! Hopefully not."
14900,"It takes two seconds to Google apigenin to find out it doesn't have studies backing his claims about sleep, a guest also challenged him on that. He used to also recommend ice baths without realizing they hurt muscle growth but he now adds a caveat about needing to wait before doing them when working out. I knew he was wrong at first and don't have a PhD. 

Like i said, if you scrutinize his claims before incorporating them, he's a net positive. If you aren't able to do this then yeah, find another podcast."
14901,Yup just released the 1st ep of the next season with the announcement
14902,That's actually pretty interesting to hear. I was excited when they did the TV thing and hoped someone would have helped in that area at the time. Good for him.
14903,I'm glad you said this! I was just thinking yesterday about how much I liked Lore but couldn't stand the way he talks! I might go back and re-listen.
14904,"It's not text to speech!? I also only listened to the first few and was like ""I can't listen to a robot for an hour..."""
14905,They actually have been remaking the earlier episodes!
14906,He has a very soothing voice.
14907,YEEESSS.
14908,"I can see that. I find the more in-depth topics are usually  2 or 3 parts. The vast majority of episodes are so well written, the quality of production, for me, makes up for the shorter times. 
I don't like podcast where I have to listen to people freewheel a conversation. Tight, well written, and well produced podcasts are more my thing."
14909,"I'll check it, thanks."
14910,"Can heavily recommend Margaret and Cool People Who Did Cool Stuff.
As I said in another comment, my leading theory is that it exists so that Cool Zone Media fans (and Sophie) don't just lose our minds from listening to too much BTB!"
14911,Jamie Loftus elevates anything she touches.
14912,fair enough. I can relate to all three so I do not mean it with any judgement ofc
14913,[sigh] Robeeerrt...
14914,"Sophie is at least 50% responsible for that podcast being as good as it is, even if her only job is to keep Robert reigned in. Her being the one to say ""Robert get to the fucking point"" or ""Robert, that joke wasn't funny the first 9 times you told it"" works as stand-in for the audience so often, and if she ever left the show I would bet anything it would become impossible to listen to and every series would suddenly be 6 parts long with 5 of them being Robert just going into jackass mode. 

Don't get me wrong, I love Robert, but he's a typical podcaster. Left to his own devices, he ruins the things he loves. But with the right amount of balance? She seriously brings out the best in him."
14915,"""Hey, I'm from Boston!"" said in the most perfect Boston accent."
14916,I'M FROM BOSTEEN
14917,Iheart's ads are annoying enough that i'd rather listen to ads for blue apron's child hunting island than hear about lance bass or rosie odonnel's podcasts again
14918,I chuckled just reading your comment
14919,"Hey, it's not Ben's fault that he's so small that his perception of others is warped."
14920,I've been describing it as a true crimes against humanity comedy podcast
14921,"Ok, I just listened to the first Heydrich episode. You're 100% correct."
14922,`ALL HAIL THE GLOW CLOUD.`
14923,"You should! The audio book is such a great listen! Also, if you haven't read the Faceless Old Woman yet, you should check that one too! It's one of my favorites."
14924,That's good to hear. I'm always happy to find a new podcast I can listen to from the beginning and have years to catch up on. I just got all the way caught up on ONRAC a little while ago so I'm glad I have a new one to do it with.
14925,You'd like calamity. Brennan guest dms critical role. It's... intense.
14926,I basically only listen to The Adventure Zone and Not Another D&D Podcast. Not saying that it would be your cup of tea but I've tried most of the other podcasts that people are suggesting to you and I don't like most of them either. I couldn't even get into Critical Role and I know everybody loves it.
14927,"I haven't either, Balance is the only TAZ arc I've listened all the way through, haven't made it past a couple episodes of a few of their other arcs. 

I've listened to all of Dungeons & Daddies though :)"
14928,"I pushed through Graduation and enjoyed Ethersea, but Steeplechase has captured some of that early magic while also being distinctly new and different because of Justin's lack of former GMing and the Blades game system. It's SO good."
14929,I liked the mini-arcs they did but dropped off early in graduation and only listened to 2-3 episodes each of ethersea and steeplechase before bouncing
14930,Balance
14931,"Your nuts, nick is easily the best stand up but hates it, and he's genuinely a halfway decent actor as well."
14932,stav is awful on the podcast
14933,it helps that i'm from baltimore and love his ravens / dundalk content
14934,"I hate how accurate this is, and yet I still find him entertaining..."
14935,"They do so many projects I just think they've stretched themselves too far and their content suffers. They're still great though, just in decline."
14936,"I'll give it a shot.

""Send a message to Admiral Hansen, we have engaged the podcast."""
14937,Welcome back bucket!
14938,"I might have to give that another try. I've seen it recommended a few times in this thread, but I just wasn't into it after the first episode."
14939,"I'm honestly not a huge Theo fan. I've never listened to any of his podcasts or anything, so I don't know his mannerisms very well.

He's got a schtick and it works, not shitting on him, he's a funny dude but his stage character isn't a tough one to emulate haha."
14940,It's beautiful.
14941,Just gotta turn off 99% of your brain cells and get weird with it
14942,Don't worry. We are going to take it back.
14943,RIP bres 
14944,What I could've been doing that this whole time 
14945,"Zip.  


...Reeeecruuuhhhtahhhghhh"
14946,I say this at work when someone enters a room.
14947,What is it's mission!?
14948,It's been on for like 5 years now there's loads of content. Beware the sound issues through the first like 30 episodes.
14949,"You should also try Nocturnal Transmissions, Knifepoint Horror, 12 Ghosts, A Voice from Darkness, and The Last Movie. I'm always on the lookout for good horror audio dramas too!

Edit: almost forgot Lovecraft Investigations!!!"
14950,he has a very female-heavy listener base. Reddit is very male-dominated
14951,How does putting it on a single site make it not a podcast? it's still a digital file that you can download or stream
14952,"I would never, ever be using disgust, demean, hate or things that verge on contempt in this way, those are extremely strong words, but i get your point. Sorry, but those are not the right words for what you're saying. I think i know what you mean, but like, i would hate to have myself described that way towards my partner."
14953,Loved Limetown
14954,"Teddy Rex. Moosey, Teddy Rex."
14955,Hahaha I didn't even notice that
14956,"Also Hell On Earth, check it out, they're wrapping up Appendicies now

But yes they are consistent, which is why it was fun when it was new and less fun now that Colbert's making their jokes half the time."
14957,"He's not.  You'll see soon enough. 

His crowdwork gave him an audience but he has no idea how to expand beyond ""do you squirt"" or ""do you still hug your dad?"" 

... problem is, dude is just lazy as fuck.  That's obvious by reaching 375lbs at 5'4"
14958,[deleted]
14959,"I mean, the point is a good one. It's a good reason to be critical of a study, but throwing something out solely due to funding sources is goo-goo-gah-gah thought."
14960,I interpret that as reddit being the fox news of the left wing internet.
14961,"These homies listening to the industry clones that are shit out by like WSJ, NPR, and NYT lol. Fine if you dabble in those, but its like these people go through the podcast main page and follow the first 3 they see lol"
14962,Exactly.
14963,Hope you enjoyed the rest of Beef!
14964,It's quite literally the biggest podcast in the world and he's has never had to advertise it. His podcast is good and people keep coming back.
14965,"If you're listening to JRE for what Joe Rogan has to say, you're missing the entire point."
14966,"I honestly do not give a shit about what Rogan says. That's the point of the podcast. Rogan invites people in a subject he doesn't know a lot about to ask them questions and have a conversation. Basically the point of Rogan is to keep the conversation going and interesting by saying random shit.

Edit: also your comment was extremely weird. It's irks me for a unknown reason maybe you said ""I've also told people I do not care about Rogan"". Like okay that's cool and all but why? I don't fucking know you so I don't care what you've told other people. Say something of substance not just ""I've told other people I don't like this thing""."
14967,"A: people but podcast preferences in their dating profiles?

B: That take comes off pretty closed minded. There are a lot of people who I don't for example, who I try to listen to and ask myself why do people connect with this. And usually there are elements of everyone that I can relate with. Discounting EVERYTHING someone says based on a take they have or thing they are associated with is how ideologies become doctrine for people and how extremists are born."
14968,Yeah who cares lmao. Weirdo.
14969,"As a father of a 3 year old, I disagree."
14970,"He's one of the better interviewers alive. What makes the podcast great is his curiosity, he asks great questions to get the best out of his guests."
14971,"He's actually pretty good at not talking over his guests and letting them talk until they finish their point, Neil Degrasse Tyson on the other hand will interrupt Joe every 4 or 5 words. 

Old pre-covid Rogan was a lot better though, I used to listen to it a lot more than I do these days. He definitely changed after he got that big Spotify deal."
14972,"Did Rogan bang your girlfriend? I'm not a huge fan of his, but this vitriol comes from a different place."
14973,"He undeniably has some silly perspectives but hits simply untrue to say he 'ramble over' his guests. 

The rest of your comment just seems to be vitriol so no point addressing that lol."
14974,Joe barely spoke in the 3 hours he spent with Edward Snowden. He knows when to get out of the way and let the guest tell a compelling story.
14975,"Media slander regarding things he's actually admitted to doing?

Like all the racist shit he spewed?"
14976,"I watched him when I was younger and ill admit he was entertaining, but even outside of the negative effects he has (like going on other peoples podcast with alex jones and supporting him about alex jones, saying that people that were against alex jones on sandy hook were part of a liberal cult, and letting anti vax doctors \[most of whom tried to sell the cure to covid after the episode\] spread anything they want) he feels a lot less like his own entity when talking to people and more boring. I will admit that this may be from bias from what hes spreading even in episodes ive watched when he doesnt do this i just dont find him to be the person that made me a listener of the pod for years."
14977,[deleted]
14978,[deleted]
14979,huh?
14980,"I think anyone that touts Ivermectin as a cure for Covid and platforms Alex Jones is right wing loon regardless of whatever else they've done.

Not to mention doubting whether we landed on the Moon."
14981,"> Or do you just think he's a right wing nut because that's what reddit told you to think?

Obviously."
14982,"Yeah so true, him supporting bernie cancles out saying alex jones is right about sandy hook."
14983,They make no sense mse anymore
14984,"Aye, not only is he pretty good at interviewing most people but he's able to get all those guests in the first place.  The combo of those two factors is why his podcast is #1.  He's there to get and empower his guests and otherwise be relatively unimportant.

&nbsp;

Because despite people's focus on Joe and despite being called the Joe Rogan experience, its not about Joe.  And that's something the haters simply cannot change about their mentality.  To them the show and why its bad is all about Joe and he's not even the focal point in the first place haha.  They've missed the mark from the very beginning."
14985,"So are many other people that have podcasts and aren't spreading nonsense at the same time.

Conan for example.

Shit even Smartless does a better job.

Maron, etc..."
14986,"Considering 40% of Americans are Trumpers, that's a statistical certainty, which makes it kind of a stupid argument. I'm sure some of them like dancing with the stars too."
14987,"He didn't advocate for them, he literally just talked about them which was a huge no-no back then"
14988,"I've listened to the show since the beginning (some periods less than others). I don't need to google to know what the man has said. If you do, maybe you shouldn't be commenting on his opinions."
14989,That was never his claim.
14990,Watch him and Theo I thought they were hilarious
14991,"Yeah but libs tend to rage way harder if someone ""platforms"" a conservative than the other way around."
14992,"Be more specific of this agenda you speak of. 
 Also,  leftist radical ideologies have been going mainstream.  That's much more threatening than Q-anon basment dwellers. 

Pay close attention to what sorts of terrorism antifa has been engaged in.  Rarely reported on"
14993,"This is so true! I am not from the US but by global standards the 2 of them are the only politicians I know at most are on center left and the rest are either center right, right, and far right."
14994,The best indicator that someone is balanced is when both sides bitch about the person being unbalanced.  Your spit take says more about you than it does about JR or the person you responded to.
14995,[removed]
14996,Not in the least.
14997,"Ya know, /u/NeoPossum used to be better before they started using reddit.  Then they just started repeating things that felt like they were copy pasted and lost all identity so most of their recent stuff just isn't that good anymore.

&nbsp;

They used to talk about stuff like shrinkflation and mathematics.  Now it's all ""elon musk"" this, ""joe rogan' that, arguing about covid, conspiracy theories, how billionaires are terrible people, and etc."
14998,"Mark is funny. Shane is hilarious. You're right about comedy, though."
14999,"Yeah, I'm intolerant of a dude that made money selling dick pills by slandering murdered children. And I'm intolerant of folks platforming the dude. As if I didn't see this shitass argument coming when I posted my original comment. 

""Tolerance"" and ""having an open mind"" doesn't mean ""Pour everything into my brain that exists sans filter mechanism"". 

At some point you have to examine something and be like ""Nah-that's not going in here"". 

You can make whatever tired old ""sO mUcH foR tHe toLerAnt leFt!"" argument as if it's something new and isn't 100% in bad faith as to what tolerance means...but you're just gonna look just as full of shit as Jones."
15000,"Yeah, they must be brigading this thread. I went from like 9 upvotes down to 1 and the post I was replying to went from -7 to 20. Ridiculous. And the only responses I've gotten are akin to ""LOL THIS GUY EXPECTS ROGAN TO BE AN EXPERT ON EVERYTHING"" which is a weird way to gloat about how misinformed he actually is."
15001,"And now they're blocking me  

Edit: And downvoting me lmao"
15002,"No. He's supposed to do what he's done before. 

""Wow, is that right? Is that true? Can you pull anything up for that? Let's look that up right now.""

Not, ""Wow."" ""Yeah."" ""Really?"""
15003,[deleted]
15004,"How does Joe Rogan know it's misinformation?

JFC....by doing homework on the subject."
15005,"They think Joe's an absolute moron, yet expect him to refute 'experts'. Oh the irony."
15006,Even so called experts getting it wrong lately which is why people listen to jre. It's just a conversation and you can tell more about a person from that than some gotcha 3 min news interview
15007,He sure acts like one sometimes..
15008,">The Robert Malone who owns several MRNA patents?

*who says he owns several mRNA patents"
15009,AKA Reddit is full of children
15010,"Ehh, I don't really agree with this. I feel like the only time he really brings up those 3 topics is when he is trying to make a point.
which never made sense to me. 
If he brings a guest expert on, he shouldn't be explaining it like he knows it better than him. that's where my problem lies. 

by far my favorite episode by him was where he had billy corgan on. what an awesome episode. he was very respectful, and corrected himself when he was wrong and let bill talk. highly recommend."
15011,Hoarding wealth how what should he do with it and how much should he give away how much should he live on per year And how much wealth should each person be allowed to have per year
15012,"Anti government partisan how

He had Bernie sanders on and said he would vote for him before"
15013,lol imagine being proud to be pro-government
15014,Did you just admit to being pro government?
15015,That's intolerant and narrow minded
15016,"why do you assume i think he's a dipshit ? 

walk with the wise, and you learn. I think he's very open minded, unlike a lot of other podcasts, where they bring people on just to argue.

he's overconfident."
15017,Oh I didn't realise until now. Managed to find it [here](https://youtu.be/SYVXPMgYHug)
15018,I didn't take it and it's been prescribed to humans for years but ok stupid.
15019,"He didn't seem mad, but you sure are looking dumb. Haha"
15020,"...it's not ""daring"" to name the most popular podcast on earth - it's just boring. 

You lot are so fucking dramatic."
15021,Can't win em all.. funny how you don't hear Republicans saying that...
15022,"Yup, thankfully we can step outside into real life."
15023,His recent episode with Coffeezilla is great. I hadn't listened to the podcast in years but made my way back for that one specifically
15024,Nope just one I'm a fool.
15025,"I think that definitely plays a factor in the decline, sure. But the problem to me is no other podcast has the proper format to really bring out the wonder and excitement the person being interviewed has to offer. I've tried watching some of his previous guests that I found really interesting on other podcasts/shows but they're always unnatural and contain forced shitty jokes and it just doesn't feel the same. With all his flaws Joe does a great job of not really carrying the interview instead he's just guiding it and asking good questions along the way. It's a shame his guests are lame most of the time now"
15026,No it's just you incorrectly desribed the entire podcast
15027,Don't you have some bud light to shoot up?
15028,"*Democrat party talking points, not liberal. By all sane/classical definitions, Rogan's quite liberal."
15029,Aw you a little upset?
15030,"What is wrong with listening to people and having discussions with people you disagree with? I like it when I have a conflicting ideology with his guests, it makes the episode more interesting, you understand the thought process that lead other people to reach such different conclusions to you, it makes you question if you were right to begin with , and that can only be a good thing."
15031,Well thats quite the comparison. Straight to the extreme eh
15032,">He said, on an upvoted comment about Joe Rogan. The persecution fetish is real lol.

Is English not your first language?"
15033,Just saw Sam Talent live. He was great.
15034,"Sorry you feel that way, hopefully Joe will go back to the old ways. Maybe mention it in a comment section of one of his podcasts, I am sure Jamie or one of the other crew members will see it lol! As long as you still enjoy listening to the podcasts it still serves you in some kind of way :)"
15035,Yeah but you opinion is irrelevant to me
15036,And why is that?
15037,"they still call themselves sisters, have a good weekend marry ell lol"
15038,"I'm not really seeing anything of substance, honestly. I don't think it's wrong for them to purchase things with money they've earned, even if it is a second home.

Also, I've been a Patreon since 2020 and recently moved to Wondery where they covered my subscription for a year. I don't recall any long period of time without new episodes but maybe that was before my time?

I don't think there's any grounds to saying Alaina isn't a real AT, that thought never crossed my mind. I didn't find anything that made me go, oh damn I didn't know that...

Also, the ""it"" comment Ash made was an reference to that person's character and not an attempt to be disrespectful to trans people or treat them any kind of way. I remember hearing that episode when it came out. 

Idk I just don't see it."
15039,You said you're a pathologist assistant? That's fascinating. Do you mind giving me some examples of what makes you think Alaina isn't telling the truth?
15040,"Idk man it's taking that guy a long time to get in shape lmao. Youtube shorts is where its at, atleast it's america selling my data to the Chinese instead of the other way round"
15041,"Huh, I wonder why it's amassed over a billion views then..."
15042,That's a brilliant take.  I hadn't thought of it that way but you're absolutely right.
15043,"Stop trying to have your own gotcha moment, I didn't even engage in that argument. Just pointed out he only argues with people with nowhere near as much background in debates, often targeting kids to debate with, because that's the only way he wins."
15044,Lol the person in the episode said that they couldn't.  You guys can't even listen properly.
15045,It's pretty much the same. He books people he thinks are interesting and just has a 2-3 hour conversation with them. I have learned a ton from his guests.
15046,"She writes a great deal of her own material for the show, and often times delivers breaking news with no script. I'm actually more into her books though. She's written two, both sort of political histories I'd call them. 'Drift' is about the American military-industrial complex from approximately the Vietnam War era through to the War on Terror. And 'Blowout' is generally about the global natural gas/fossil fuel industry in the 21st century, though it focuses principally on Russia and the US."
15047,Yes I know I get downvoted  but don't care screw the loser masses are asses lol  I like what I like thanks enough
15048,"Nice guess, but no. It was Gilbert having lunch with Charles Manson.

'I was having lunch with Charles Manson, in the middle of lunch he turns to me and he said ""Is it hot in here or am I crazy?""'"
15049,You don't need to interact with me
15050,Idk why i wrote that actually. I think i was bitter chatgpt was at full capacity so i couldn't remember that an alternative to a podcast is music not talkong
15051,"Oh man, it gets worse. He left the month before covid leaving me with our 5yo and 8mo who had just undergone back to back brain surgeries. Good times! He's doing better now and has become a good dad to them both, we get along fine (surprising I know)."
15052,"What I mean to say is that he's clearly an amateur. You can tell he's reading from a prepared script and that's perfectly fine. I think he's a phenomenal podcaster, but he's not a journalist like Dan Carlin or as good of a writer as Malcolm Gladwell.

From a presentation stand point it's kinda, meh, but he's just so damn passionate, thorough, and relevant that you can't help but want more after every episode.

He's good the way, say, Dominic Hasek was. He doesn't hit all the boxes of what traditionally made a good goalie. But holy frick he kept the puck out of the net. That's what I mean. I didn't mean it as a slight to Duncan."
15053,good to know
15054,"Its definitely a personal preference case. Dan Carlin has way more inflection, especially when recounting primary sources, which a lot of people like but for me its honestly a low point in an otherwise amazing podcast. Duncan's fairly level voice is something I'm personally a big fan of, but it may be because he just was the first podcaster I listened to so it set an expectation going forward."
15055,"Also, Robin has the absolute best voice for podcasting."
15056,"If you haven't read/listened to it, I suggest ""The Storm Before the Storm"" by Duncan. On audiobook, it feels exactly like HoR. It goes from the Gracchi through Sulla, setting the stage for the First Triumvirate.

15057,"We weren't taught about the Haitian Revolution because Haiti is not a world power like America or Russia or China. Its a failed state. If Haiti had defeated Hitler then they might be relevant to high school history classes.

&#x200B;

If you look at the broad sweep of the Revolutions podcast, Duncan is mostly talking about failed revolutions or revolutions that produced failed states. 

The only two revolutions that would lay the foundation of a country to become a world power in the future is the American Revolution and the Russian Revolution and maybe the Chinese Revolution depending on how the next 20 years shake out."
15058,"Very well could be the problem I'm having. I'm so used to different ""unscripted"" (talk show like) podcasts and audiobooks that Mike's delivery just kinda throws me off. I'll give it another go I think. 

Also, just gotta remind myself that if I want to focus and learn and get something out of these, maybe I need to really exercise some self discipline and not scroll around on my phone or do other things (besides walking/driving) while listening!"

I still don't know where the joke was. Someone played a random sound effect and then the whole cast just broke down like they were 3 edibles in and watching standup comedy.  I also haven't heard virtually anything about the subject of the podcast. Just people laughing their asses off for no reason. But hey, I know the hosts pronouns, so good thing we have the important stuff covered."

15100,"Interesting! My takeaway... or at least how I have remembered it - its been a long time since I read it... was more along the lines of ""If you have a $100, instead of spending it on garbage or putting it under your bed in a shoebox, go find something that can make your money work for you. If you have to take out a loan, ok.""

I still use this. Not that I can attribute that TO Kawasaki, but there is an acorn of built in knowledge I currently have that I feel pretty confident pointing back to that book. I read a second one of his (don't remember what) and it completely didn't resonate with me. 

A second takeaway I had is that poor dad busted his ass and because he spent like a good little consumer, he still ended up with squat and still having to bust his ass. 

What I also recognized at that time, was that basically, he was telling people to lever themselves into oblivion. I was recovering from being a financial moron, so I knew to steer clear of that."

15104,"In the defence of freakonomics, or was it Malcolm gladwell. Possibly both. There was a chapter about the validity of intuition of firefighters or police and other experts in their field.

Someone correct me please."
15105,"It's like people who say science isn't a creative pursuit. Good logic requires a great deal of creativity and most of the scientists I know are also artists, musicians, writers, or have some other sort of hobby like that.

The fact that most people fail to recognize the limitations of intuition doesn't mean it has no uses."
15106,Do they actually say that in the book though? That certainly wasn't what I took away from it
15107,"Did you hear the one about the unbiased scientist? After 20 years of research he published the result ""dogs are not getting enough treats"". Anyway later it turned out that the scientist was a dolphin"
15108,"I remember listening to those podcasts and now realize I was not listening to their arguments, just the random data. I say that because I just remember that naming your kid differently might cause your child to suffer from prejudice. Plot twist: i named my child a less American name nevertheless. Also English is not my first language."
15109,"Yes, this is what their argument is in that section. I listened to their podcast episode on it recently."
15110,"Ooooh, that's a brilliant point, didn't know that. Thanks for sharing!!"
15111,"Well that's sort of the problem with the book isn't it? The statistics can be (and are) framed in a specific way to disregard the actual issues caused by classist tones to reinforce (as the podcast would argue) a neoliberal ""bootstraps"" mentality while selectively ignoring that even if it's not the explicit body of focus, the explicit body of focus is still a clear correlary to the actual issues of discrimination people take issue with.

This isn't to say (in my personal opinion) ""feakanomics bad,"" so much as ""freakanomics not impartial."" The book presents itself as raw data spewing facts from the bad boys of regression analysis, when really its a quaint look at how economic principles can work in a practical setting. It's a gateway book to understanding, not an end book, but for most readers of airport non-fiction, it's disposable media that will never lead to deeper thought."
15112,"It has been some years, you're probably right. Lemme link the [controversy](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/freakonomics-what-went-wrong)."
15113,"The names section is a microcosm of what makes the book as a whole a problem. It asks the question ""do names matter"" and keeps giving choppy, partial, underconsidered answers. For example, the book criticizes racial resume audits on the basis that names that sound Black also sound poorer than names that sound white. Therefore, the authors suggest, evidence that Black-sounding names generate fewer job opportunities isn't evidence of racism but instead could be evidence of class prejudice. But the book should stop and think about what it means that there's a stereotypic link between Black-sounding names and poverty, and whether this link is a way that racism operates. Instead, the book quickly jumps on to a bunch of unrelated stuff about naming.

Each important idea it raises is treated like this --- too briefly, too shallowly, too incuriously. It's written as if by a very uninterested undergrad who speedread a couple of graduate syllabi for some reason and then wrote a book report."
15114,"I had a medical rotation serving in a prison and there was a guy named Demon. I kid you not. Pronounced deh MON, but yeah spelled Demon. Wonder what happened that sweet little Demon ended up in prison. Gee, let's look at Day one. How could he not have ended up there, that's the question."
15115,"So if I name my daughter ""Fart"" then scientifically speaking, she wouldn't suffer in society because of that name? Good to know."
15116,"Actually, they had the other popular explanation: the legalization of abortion due to Roe v Wade caused the crime drop. They said it might be responsible for something like 80% of the drop, something that they point out in the podcast has been mostly disproven."
15117,"It's been a long time since I read it, but I think it posed it as a question, then offered examples from studies that suggest it does make a difference, then offers a counterexample.  Then it may make some sort of conclusion.  The conclusion itself might be of dubious value, but the questions and examples were interesting.  

Probably the most famous chapter was ""Does legalized abortion affect crime rates?""  Then they present some evidence suggesting that it does then some sort of demonstration that it's definitely not the only driver of crime, and then they put a number on it (ie. X% of the drop in national crime rates was because roe v wade, offset by 20+ years because that's how long it takes unwanted kids to turn into crime-committing adults).  

A lot of the complaints were that it's not unvarnished truth -- there is nuance and uncertainty in such questions.  But it's an interesting question I hadn't considered before, the studies on it are interesting, and you're free to take or leave their estimate.  Basically, it's interesting because of the questions, not because of the answers the author provides.

Anyway, the format is pretty popular -- you'll see it in a bunch of other pop sci books.

With regard to names, they do the same.  Pose the question, show some evidence to think it makes a difference, then show a couterexample (winner vs loser), and I honestly don't remember their conclusion.  Probably that it makes some amount of difference but obviously doesn't dictate outcomes."
15118,"I think I remembered the complete reverse lesson. And after reading through the whole American Scientific critique of the book I can now gladly say that the book's negative reputation is deserved by the overconfident writing style being mildly deceptive.  A more nuanced style is required for people who literally parse the text rather than searching for the 2nd or 3rd layer of meaning or the bounty of new ideas presented. IMO since its purpose is to popularize ways of thinking and statistical fallacies rather than to seek an objective truth, it is still a great read."

15122,"I really can't remember exactly where it occurred but I think it was the black names/outcomes segment where they were like we don't have enough data here to say that black names result in worse outcomes for employment, meanwhile that premise has been studied to death and always produced the same result. Black names does result in less job offers etc

The abortion segment was always bad from memory and the authors straight up didn't understand/ignored the context around abortion legalization in the US and the countries they compared the US to. Their numbers were also wrong here in places."
15123,"They definitely could have structured the episode better. 

Their best arguments against the book are in the last 15-20 minutes of the podcast, which is centered around the crime and abortion chapters. 

Freakonomics cites a Polish study as evidence of abortion legalization reducing crime 18 years later, when the study actually found the opposite to be true. Freakonomics just outright lies about the study.

The podcast also points out how the Freakonomics economist's paper, looking at murder rates, had outright data errors that had to be corrected, and, once you make those corrections, the data doesn't really support their argument (if it ever did to begin with).

To me, the misuse of data combined with a clear narrative bias is a much stronger argument that the Freakonomics authors shouldn't be trusted."
15124,">	If you investigate society by making wild conclusions based on questionable data then your field of study is incredibly reckless! 

The book presents conclusions, and provides a rough overview of the evidence which the conclusion is based on. If you want to refute those conclusions, we have a process for that through universities and scientific journals. 

Most criticism of the book is refuting those conclusions. But the book is not about the conclusions, the book is about the process through which we draw the conclusions. The book is not called, ""Blowing the lid off of sumo wrestling!"" The authors have demonstrated a willingness to reevaluate those conclusions as new data becomes available, and I don't know what else you could hope for. 

Another criticism is that behavioral economics isn't really economics. That's not really a criticism of the book per se, but rather, a criticism of behavioral economics as a science. That criticism is a much bigger scope than the book, and the book is only a target because it's popular.

>	If you're going to use your academic standing to sound off on these incredibly mighty topics it is vitally important that what you are saying is true.

I believe that every topic covered in the book has a scientific study to support the conclusions. What more do you expect from a book with laypeople as the audience?"

15127,Ya that's how I've been feeling about it too lately. The first like 10 episodes I really enjoyed but lately it seems they're just trying to knock everyone and everything down for the sake ofnit
15128,This is a comment based on feelings rather than actually having listened to any of the episodes.
15129,And CICO bullshit!
15130,No kidding. People can't believe that fat people aren't stupid and lazy and choosing to be fat. Bums me out
15131,I think about the episode where Harvard Medical School tried to ruin that CDC researcher's career all the time.
15132,"Fwiw, I've known a few people, very obese, who said stuff just like this for years.

Then they lost weight. I don't know how they did it, various ways I'm sure but they did.

And they're shocked by two things. 1) First that it was possible. They had been convinced by the pro-fat or fat-acceptance advocates that it wasn't, that it was just how they were. And the second thing, 2) is just how big a difference it's made in their lives. They feel so much better, have so much more energy. 

 I don't want to shame people. I want people to feel good about themselves. But I also don't want to deliver a message that holds people back, that lessens the joy and happiness they can experience in life."
15133,[deleted]
15134,"This take is important, but completely ignores a few things. Being fat isn't set in stone for most. There's the medical cases, and there's the people who enjoy food that's bad for them a little too much while not being interested in sports or exercise as well. Nothing to judge there either, but it is how it is. It's a complex thing, not cookie cutter. Saying it's just systemic is just as bad as saying it's just diet. It'll just cause more issues.  
  
And fat shaming is more than just beauty, too. There's a lot of other health issues and concerns that arise from being very overweight. If someone is as round as they can deal with, whatever. If someone can't walk or do other things normally necessary properly because of their weight, that's an issue not to be ignored."
15135,"The problem with what you're saying is that it's wrong. Maintenance  Phase can't actually be academically rigurous if they make such silly claims as individuals have little to no control over their weight when it's been proven that you can control your weight through controling your caloric intake. So, sure, some people have medical conditions that make it hard to impossible to properly control their weight, but you have to have zero intelligence to claim the guy eating thousands of calories a day and drinking 10 cans of pepsi has no choice but to do so and he can't do anything to help himself."
15136,[removed]
15137,"100% agree and that's the kind of issue I'm generally in alignment with HAES on. My problem is when certain figures seem to downplay or deliberately misinform followers about the health consequences of their lifestyle choices. 

I think it's great to be fat and happy, but I want those people to understand the full spectrum of outcomes that come with that, so they can be empowered to make deliberate decisions about their health and well-being."
15138,"Absolutely, but in both those cases the patient is in extremis. In your second situation, shouldn't addressing the patient's weight (which is possibly causative) be part of a longer term treatment plan?"
15139,"A lot of the points they make aren't even questioning the validity of scientific evidence, they just look into what the scientific evidence *actually is*. Often, common understanding of weight and health *isn't* based on a broad modern scientific consensus. Sometimes it's based on the writings of some 19th century guy who was also super into eugenics, or is based on science that has since been explicitly debunked in a way that hasn't gone mainstream, or is an aspect of modern science that *is* up to date, but is being presented to the public disingenuously to sell supplements.

If I could boil down the thesis statements the show makes the most often, they would be that:

1. Treating someone's weight as an indicator of their *moral character* is a shitty way to treat people.
2. Treating weight as the *sole measure* of a person's health isn't effective and can lead people to do to things that are just as bad, if not *worse*, for their health than being fat.

Any time they ""debunk"" something, they aren't really debunking it themselves so much as they are highlighting the work of scientists who might otherwise not be getting exposure."
15140,They mention constantly that they reach out to professionals in the community to hard check their conclusions and understanding.
15141,"Anything that doesn't fuel someone's fatphobic beliefs becomes 'pseudoscience', because they can't cope with anything against that belief. Tale as old as time."
15142,"It sure can be. That's exactly what fossil fuel and tobaccco companies do about climate change and smoking. You just cherry pick the studies you like, overemphasis flaws, and reason poorly about them. The ""sweeping conclusion"" they're opposed to the robust medical consensus (that obesity is bad for you) that contradicts their own fringe belief. They imply dieting is ineffective because people regain weight. This is analogous to claiming smoking cessation is ineffective because people resume smoking."
15143,"You mean William Rehnquist, the guy who (while clerking at SCOTUS) wrote a memo arguing Brown v. Board should be decided in favor of segregation?

Yeah, fuck that asshole. We should erect an outhouse over his grave."
15144,Hard same. I think this is the only one of the three podcasts where he's got a buddy who'll really just snicker and mock as gleefully as possible.
15145,"She just amazes me with the connections her brain makes and the hilarious analogies she comes up with on the fly. I have literally pulled my car over to take note of something funny she said so I could text it to people.

It may need to be said that she doesn't have the best voice, but that's true of a lot of podcasters and once I get someone and find them endearing, it's easy for me to overlook that."
15146,Yeah.  I'm sadly otherwise aware.
15147,"No, he wasn't saying that at all, that was my commentary on his playbook.

He was espousing the values of, in my view, making those questionably legal and generally amoral decisions."
15148,It does.
15149,Damn....what is it? lol
15150,"Seems good. Very commercially viable. If you could also demonstrate some behaviour other than what you teach, that'd be another check in the box."
15151,Yeah I liked the RD/PD episode because they pointed out that good financial advice is actually *super boring* and wouldn't be a bestseller lol.
15152,"This. There are advancements in machine learning, but he wasn't referring to that. Freakonomics is just bad statistics in any era of statistics."
15153,Yeah just looked through some of the sources for the criticism on their episode and their sources don't seem particularly scathing.
15154,"Yep. The one that really stood out to me was a recent ep on some low-cal diet where women experienced amenorrhea and hair loss. Both Michael and Aubrey were aghast and doing their LoOk aT THis CrAZy SiDE EfFeCT, but a quick Google (and any menstruating person who's had a brush with low-weight anorexia will be quick to point out) that those are really common side effects. Sarah has struggled with some form of ED, and I wonder if having her voice in the convo would have made it into a different outcome. I just feel like there's a loss of question-asking lately, and more smugness."
15155,Because it's not a real word and most of us who know about their mathematical errors and general bullshit don't care enough to learn to spell their made up buzz word.
15156,"
I replied to someone with this elsewhere in the thread, but I think these two examples were their strongest arguments against Freakonomics. 

Their best arguments against the book are in the last 15-20 minutes of the podcast, which is centered around the abortion and crime chapters. Freakonomics cites a Polish study as evidence of abortion legalization reducing crime 18 years later, when the study actually found the opposite to be true.

To me, the misuse of data combined with a clear narrative bias are much stronger arguments that the Freakonomics authors shouldn't be trusted."
15157,"Sure they can, but why would they waste their time when you could literally just go listen to the episode yourself. It is not that long."
15158,"I listened to it today. Honestly, I think they completely missed the point of the book. It's a fun pop sci look into some academic papers to get the reader to think differently and consider the interconnections between things. It wasn't meant to revolutionize the world. 

The two guys just kept reading random sentences from the book and then guffawing before offering no or weak genuine critisism. I thought the podcast hosts were idiots with a superiority complex that was undeserved. There was way too much opinion and shitty banter and very, very little substance. I might try one of the other episodes but that one was a little edgy for my tastes."
15159,"Was it the first or second episode they made fun of the self help books? Can't remember now, anyway they claim a lots of things based on experiences, because they n,ever experienced it, absolutely zero evidence. And that they are successful is irrelevant, as I am sure you know a lot of successful people that are shitty, like Musk or Poutine or Trump"
15160,Your podcast is what made me switch careers to IT. Great stuff we really appreciate you!
15161,Love your podcast man! Keep being great!
15162,"I read this comment in your voice. Hope your break is treating you well, sir!"
15163,"Love your podcast! Also, I finally understand what your name is haha"
15164,Hey! I just wanted to say that I love the podcast and so does my one year old. We listen to it during bath time and she always dances when the intro plays.
15165,Love your podcast! Appreciate all the effort you put into getting interesting and unique stories told!
15166,I listen every time a new one comes out! Really awesome subjects!
15167,"Absolutely love your podcast! Keep doing what you're doing. That said, it did take me ~50 episodes to realize your name is Jack Rhysider rather than Jackery Sider haha."
15168,Found your podcast not too long ago and almost through all the episodes. Were my first Patreon too. Thank you for all these awesome stories.
15169,Resighter. His father was an optician.
15170,"ISC2 for CISSP... I just write-up a spreadsheet list of all the podcasts I listened to and a little summary statement for each of them and I take the conservative amount of hours (so if it's a 45 min, I ask for 30 minutes - if it's 1hr 15, I ask for 1hr... never more than 1hr per episode) and submit that as evidence. In the past I've also taken screen-shots to show the episodes as ""read"" in my app."
15171,"I know, it's a bit on the nose isn't it? And the way he says it doesn't help."
15172,"I think the bank one got posted here as a TIL, listening to that hooked me immediately and made me listen to the entire back catalogue."
15173,It's hilarious
15174,"Blueprint for Armageddon. His episodes are scattered across streaming platforms. It's in Apple Music, you can also just buy them from his site and they're 100% worth it."
15175,"It's called Blueprint for Armageddon, but you have to get it through Dan Carlin's site. His podcasts are on a rolling schedule and they eventually roll through to paid content. 24 hours of the history of WWI is well worth it, though!"
15176,"It's like 5 or 6 episodes, each of which was 3 hours long. It's an incredible series."
15177,Download the app Podbean. You can find them there.
15178,Also top notch. The man just does not miss!
15179,"Ghosts of the Ostfront was also fabulous. I also love his series on the fall of the Roman Republic (and literally every other series he's done lol). 

I think my preference is for WW1 because like most Americans, my prior knowledge was Gavrilo Princip, Franz Ferdinand, the Balkans, lots of treaties, treatment of Germany led to WWII. HH added so much detail to my understanding, both of that war and WW2 (like why Paris fell so quickly, because their forces were decimated after the role they played in WW1), and beyond. It truly changed my understanding and world view."
15180,"Going from Blueprint to Ghosts is tough, because Ghosts was done many years prior and moves really fast without getting into the grittiness / detail / depth of Blueprint.  Definitely still a great and worthwhile listen though."
15181,"Thank you, just found it on his website.  The episodes just weren't listed at all on the podcast app I was using.  I'll check them out, just takes a bit to get through them when they're 3+ hours a pop! (not complaining though)."
15182,"I paid for the ones for WW2, ""something something ostfront"" when they were like $1, and when I was done i felt like I had ripped him off, the value in then is just insane, they could easily cost $20 and it would still be an amazing deal."
15183,"ohhh ok, I saw that on his site, I'm excited to listen"
15184,"I checked his website out, I see how his content is structured there. Seems like apple podcasts has some stuff but other content is for purchase on his site. I'm really excited to check his work out"
15185,"Ah. Fair. I didn't know that. I apparently made a rash assumption after I saw a bunch of people thrashing his handling of the  whole ""Belgium was the European Nanking in terms of atrocities"" as in he didn't talk about it all - was the interpretation I read which I just plain wrong. He spends like 45 minute's talking about it and how going into detail would be several episodes in itself - which is why he only spends like 45-60 minutes talking about that part of the war - and people were horribly offended because they hadn't actually listened to it themselves and wanted to cancel him. 
Shortly after I wanted to relisten to blueprint for armageddon on Spotify and was missing. I'm not on twitter so I just made a (wrong assumption"
15186,"Man, if they taught some of the real dirty shit like the School of the Americas, I might have paid more attention."
15187,"Yeah and they skipped over huge foundational portions of colonial America too, like King Philip's war"
15188,"Yeah I feel like we teach history very poorly for a few reasons.

We should teach history focused on how it shapes our lives today. I'm that way, it makes sense to teach about the American revolutionary war not in detail about which battles happened when and where, but about the 10-20 years that led up to it then the 10 or so years following focusing on the increasing grievances of the colonists and then how our government was formed following independence. But we should also not spend months learning about this because, while it's important, the further back you go the less those details matter.

We also should start modern and work backwards adding context. There's a technique for finding root causes of problems called the 5 whys. You start with the problem and simply ask ""why"". This usually leads to 1 or more related and relevant observations, but usually it's deeper, so you ask ""why"" again for each of those. Once you do this process 5 times you usually find the root cause or a sufficiently fundamental cause that it can help solve your problem. We should take essentially this approach to history. Start with a modern problem and continue to ask ""why"". 

Last, we focus too much on wars. Wars are usually times of transition, but the more relevant information is what led up to it in order to necessitate that transition and what was the outcome. The focus on specific battles and sometimes specific people takes up so much time that could be used to teach more relevant topics. If there are specific points that drastically change the outcome and the lasting impact of the war, that's fine, but we don't need every battle."
15189,"Try growing up in Texas- American Revolution, States Rights, Texas Revolution,  more Texas Revolution, WWII, then..."
15190,"I distinctly remember a page on 9/11 in my geo-politics book that was brand new in 2003 in high-school. And in elementary school we had a ton of lessons on Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement.

Oddly enough the state of Kansas had great education in the 1990s.

Did seem odd that the cold war was very much glossed over. I still remember learning the words peristroika and glasnost though."
15191,This is very intentional. Part of America obviously doesn't want to teach kids about modern history (post WWII) because it makes their political party look bad.
15192,"My kids and I talk about how they have learn 30+ years more history than me and 60+ more years than their grandparents (as in, grandparents didn't have to learn about Korean war or the Vietnam war, because it wasn't history at that point.) It's kind of wild to think about it that way. So some stuff has to get cut. Most people aside from historians don't see the direct impact of many events so it gets removed from the curriculum. There's only so much that can be covered in 12 years."
15193,I went to hs in the 60s and they stopped right before the Vietnam War. Which would be like teaching the second decade of the 21st century and not mentioning Trump.
15194,"You're not intended to understand post ww2 America as a high school student. Because, honestly, neither political party wants you to. Vietnam, Korea, Iran contra, the entire Civil rights Era. There's nothing in there to make you feel proud to be an American. So they just sell you a glorified history of our founders. 

You're not intended to understand probability  and statiatics in high school because the lottery is paying for your education, and if you understood probability, you'd never play the lotto."

15198,Oh my god yes. I could tell you so many things about Mesopotamia.
15199,Thank you!!
15200,You are making it way more nefarious than it actually is. Many teachers don't make or stick to a scope and sequence and run out of time. It's not that complicated.
15201,this is a silly take. sorry if this was the case with your education but it's not ubiquitous. sounds like you're pushing more of a narrative than any high school might
15202,My theory is it is glossed over because it was gruesome waste of life and its pretty hard to indoctrinate blind patriotism for your country when they are just throwing you into a meat grinder. WWII had the villains and heroes to make for great storytelling.
15203,What's the TLDR for WW1?
15204,[deleted]
15205,"Maybe not militarily, but it does have a lot to do with how America began to rise in the 20th century as a military and economic powerhouse. The complete economic (and literal) destruction of Europe, America's role as a financier and military supplier in the war, and its emergence unscathed explains a lot of America's emergence and domination as one of the preeminent 20th century superpowers"
15206,"Yeah, no one knows about that one...Come on."
15207,"No, that was one of the few parts of the war in the Pacific that we *did* cover."

15210,"WW1 took down like half a dozen monarchies, broke up or created as many countries, and was the death knell for all the old great empires. WW1 is the veritable start of the then-new and arguably still current world order, with the USA replacing the UK at the helm. It's when war turned from a noble, civilized, gentlemanly pursuit into a to-the-death, no-holds-barred industrialized grudgematch.

*Vietnam* is the one that resulted in no lessons learned."
15211,You forgot the oil. Surely there was oil we freed somewhere.
15212,Not true. I learnt plenty about colonialism.
15213,That was not my experience at *all*.
15214,"Your experience certainly doesn't match my school district. 

We spent a lot of time discussing the atomic bombs.
Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes was required reading for every student in Jr. high."
15215,"I had a history teacher who spent an entire class having us debate whether or not dropping the bombs was justified, so I lucked out there. That teacher was awesome."

15217,Lol I knooow. It feels like a terrible thing to say but it truly is my favorite.
15218,All of history is old news?
15219,i don't remember them saying that but i was taught that it was definitely NOT about slavery. not at all. not even a little bit.
15220,"It's not even that it's boring, I hate to say it but it's just SIMPLE. 

Literally, winner of war pushes for change across losers of war, losers don't like it. Governments forced to take changes, some governments resist. Either way, new factories are built and move forward United economy. New President sympathetic to losers, ends reconstruction. 

Literally that's it. Maybe you need to know terms like carpet baggers and stuff? But like I said, 2 days max. 

Spanish American War, Panama Canal, and WWI have an overall greater impact to America's transition to a World Power and deciding factor into WWII."
15221,"It's about 5 or 6 episodes, but each episode is several hours long."
15222,I didn't realize he had his own website. Someone linked me to it but thanks for the info.
15223,thank god someone said it because I spent about 20m searching the Apple Podcast library lol
15224,I love history shows/books so I bet it is worth it for sure. I'll pay it!
15225,You can also buy the anthology packs or something. A bit pricy up front but you get a lot of content. I have the first two packs I think for like $80

15228,"Yeah, there should be. It's been a while but I bought his WW1 podcasts and put them on Apple Podcasts but forgot how. I think it tells you how to add them to the podcast app on his website."
15229,"Yes, but it on him website, and it will give you the ability to access it through Apple podbasts"
15230,"I dont use apple podcasts so idk but I downloaded it to my phone and when I opened it, gave me the option to play through spotify."
15231,Those movies sucked
15232,"Sounds like a great deal, you get an extra 10+ hours of content haha"
15233,"Youre probably right that the focus is on persia adjacent things for quite a while but yeah, haha he does say it 4+ times"
15234,This made me laugh way more than it should have. Congrats on the law school thing by the way!
15235,"Logical Insanity was the first episode I ever listened to, followed by Blueprint for Armageddon. Safe to say, that was a strong intro"
15236,Totally worth paying for I might add. If you're a little skeptical listen to one of his free ones to make sure you like his style of presentation.
15237,the newer ones are free but yeah once they get archived gotta pay for them
15238,"It's not that he makes things up out of whole cloth, it's that he looks at sources uncritically (and *they* may have made things up out of whole cloth). To make up an egregious example, imagine if a podcast said that George Washington is twelve stories high and made of radiation [just because, hey, there's a good second-hand source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6OOuPI5c0). So he does things like uncritically rely on Plutarch as a source ([to the point of even bringing it up in at least one episode description](https://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-35-death-throes-of-the-republic-ii/)) even though Plutarch was pretty open about the fact that he made a lot of shit up.

15239,"One particular problem I had with him was his characterization of the Greco-Persian Wars as ultimately unimportant, a sideshow to Persia that the Greeks didn't really win, because so much of Greece was sacked and the Persians just left anyway. It's an entirely wrong take that I see crop up from time to time (as the Greeks in fact launched a hugely successful counter invasion and it led directly to the creation of the Delian League and everything that came from that), and I'm pretty sure a lot of it can be traced right back to him."
15240,"I don't get what's ""centrist"" about your suggestion that historians are too sensitive about laypeople understating the difference between their work and his. Just because it treats pop history and scholarly work as comparable ways to learn about the past? I think that's actually kind of a radical claim! Do you think you and your mechanic are similarly informed because you listened to Car Talk for 20 years of weekends? It's okay to just acknowledge, ""I listen to this because it's fun and interesting, but I know better than to jump into a conversation (or god forbid an argument) with only facts from the podcast""."
15241,"> always at least strives for accuracy

Nope. IIRC he even says in some of the earlier episodes how he likes to take primary sources at face value because it makes a good story.

Many of his literary(secondary) sources that he builds his episodes on are decades old and simply wrong."
15242,"He makes it clear nearly every episode. It's not ""popular"" history."
15243,"They're doing history while he's doing entertainment. 

They're critically examining sources to the tinniest detail to paint an accurate picture, while he tells an entertaining story."
15244,"Yeah, I hadn't realised I had said anything remotely controversial. Not sure whether I was getting downvoted by people who think Carlin is actually always totally right about history, or people who thought I was being too generous with the guy. But, whatever."
15245,"But he gets people fired up about history, which is admirable."
15246,"I'd have to go searching but one of the historian subreddits did a writeup on it. It was specifically his handling of describing German war crimes in WW1, basically chalking it up to allied exaggeration."
15247,"Y'all are either old or spent too much time thinking your dad was cool. It is the only way you can explain Carlin's affected bullshit raspy ""intense"" voice as ""cool"". Its performative nerd-ass bullshit. He should be lecturing at a junior college in Idaho. And heads up, your dad is fucking lame. He likes Bad Company. Boomers blow dick. Big Dicks. Even when they're reasonably intelligent they insist on fucking affectations that ring of toxically masculine strong jawed bad actors from the 50's and early 60's. I want someone to legit convince me that Dan Carlins annoying ass growl voice isn't an affectation to make him seem more intense."
15248,Outdated sources only provide value if they are used in comparison to sources that are relevant to the current discourse. Outdated sources that are cited alone are unreliable at best and frankly unnecessary.
15249,"Sure! I'll look into it, thx"
15250,U good. I was in a pissy mood when I replied to the comments here. My bad
15251,"It might have been with Joe Rogan. Unfortunately I couldn't find it after about 20 seconds of searching lol. Maybe I'll look later. 

The story was about him personally getting invited to DC to consult with the pentagon. That itself is totally believable, but as I recall he told some convoluted story about how it was all super secret and how the military officer who picked him up from the airport was racing down country roads to lose any potential tail. 

As far as the actual historical stories go: It's basically stories that are like... the ghost of Kiev. It sounds crazy, we want it to be true. High probability it's made up propaganda or highly exaggerated. I mean who's to say but you shouldn't always take primary sources as reliable because it may sound awesome.

A lot of popular historians do this though. Stephen Ambrose, Mark Felton, etc. Still like their stuff but it can be unreliable and occasionally cringe inducing when they wade into something you happen to know a lot about. We all make mistakes mind you, it just seems like they won't let the truth get in the way of a good story."
15252,nah
15253,I wish you guys luck! You'll need it with the lack of critical thinking skills y'all  have!!
15254,Yes.
15255,Not his sources maybe but his interpretation of his sources are definitely inferior to those of actual experts within the field of the subject matter he discusses.. you think that real historians with decades of experience studying the specific historical subject he's talking about wouldn't know more than him?? Y'all are delusional if u think so.
15256,"I'm not talking about sanitation, though? I was referring to the influence of past actions and political structures/concepts that still stick with us today and influence even current events."
15257,"Yeah, some podcasts (like the Byzantine one) has to be listened to on 1.25x speed."
15258,First two seasons are honestly the weakest ones by quite a wide margin. When I recommend the show I always tell folks to start with season 3 which is also a bit of a slow burn but is also where the show really comes into its own. Most of the future seasons benefit from the context of season 3 but not so much the first two although they are definitely worth listening to after you get through the end of the show
15259,Im German so we had it in school for almost an entire year. But it is a cool revolution.
15260,"> How cruel to go from such a hopeful position

Not sure ""hopeful"" would have been my description of the position post-revolution Haiti started off with, but yeah - 4.19 is hard and invoked a lot of very conflicting and uncomfortable feelings and thoughts. 

The entire thing is one of those topics where I had a great need to have a conversation with someone about some intense feelings of helplessness, injustice and grief."
15261,"Awesome thanks! I'm not a regular Chapo listener, but I do appreciate their commitment to the true spirit of posting, so think I'll be down to clown on this one. I'm a big fan of The Age of Napoleon podcast, which Matt has been guested on a few times. He was great there so hoping for more of the same."

15263,"I know, I was just trying to be funny, but I guess it sounded better in my head."
15264,"Hey you're not a problem you have great taste in podcasts. But yes, we do indeed think about this very differently. I pictured Jad as someone who was younger, with slightly longer hair and slightly darker skin tone. Jason Schwartzman is a good guess too though."
15265,"Iirc they made a whole thing of how the infrastructure attracted large employers. That's false. Those companies were actively relocated to Bonn as compensation for the loss of governmental agencies and ministies... Which still haven't left completely. So Bonn has been compensated plentifully, for a loss that hasn't occured yet. No surprise the town is doing okay economically. That's also because many people who had a good income during the time as a capital still live their and are know bolstering the local economy using their considerable pensions. 

It is not, however a quiet economical boomtown. There's just no evidence of that, and they really didn't bother to give any."
15266,"Ellen (Brett Hawthorne's wife, not the TV host) ends up getting blown up in the nuke attack on Air Force One. That pathetic hug with his wife, when Brett Hawthorne is pretty sure he's going to die, makes me seriously suspect the parentage of Ben's kids. 

I really want a sequel. I imagine in the sequel Brett Hawthorne and Soledad Ramirez will end up either hooking up or falling for each other. I can't imagine it happening naturally, it will be forced and clunky just like Ben Shapiro's flirting techniques."
15267,"Your ideas are intriguing to me, and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter."
15268,Well they also did like 2 parts on the horrible book Ben wrote about sex

15276,"Yeah thats fair, I didn't get an unhinged vibe, more of a ""this is what happened, and based on this I think Dulles had JFK assassinated, but we will never know for sure"" which IMO is fine. Maybe he took some liberties, I don't remember. Any specifics you didn't like?"
15277,Any episode of The Dollop where Patton Oswalt is the guest is going to be excellent content but those episodes about Reagan are next fucking level.  And I don't think I've ever laughed any harder in my life than when Gareth and Patton start riffing with their Reagan voices.
15278,"Basically he has just always voted for corporate interest, war-machine interest or screwing the little guy. People say they like him because he's ""against Trump"" but he voted on Pro Trump interests the vast majority of the time. He knew first hand the horrors of war, yet he wanted to illegally expand the Vietnam war into Cambodia...which eventually did happen and arguably made it easier for the Khmer Rouge to take power, leading to the Cambodian Genocide. Also, was pro Iraq war. And he was personally profiting from war expansion. He voted against affordable healthcare multiple times and voted to strip veterans benefits at least once. Oh but hey...he was nice to Obama that one time and didn't like Trump. 

The man did do some good, and I can't imagine what he went through being a POW, but I also can't imagine voting to perpetuate war annd deny health after being a POW either."
15279,"John McCain was, in fact, not very cool at all."
15280,"My favorite excerpt was the McCain quote, 

>well at least I don't plaster on makeup like a trollop, you cunt

spoken *to his wife* in public, in response to a mild jab about his hairline (or maybe waistline?), in front of reporters, no less.

I also appreciated that he crashed two Navy planes and caused an international incident by flying recklessly into Spanish power lines.  But because daddy was an admiral, he got constant preferential treatment whereas anyone else would have gotten a swift dishonorable discharge.  From his second crash:

>Los Angeles Times, Oct. 8, 2008: In a report dated Jan. 18, 1966, the Naval Aviation Safety Center said it could not determine the cause of the accident or corroborate McCain's account of an explosion in the engine. A close examination of the engine found ""no discrepancies which would have caused or contributed to engine failure or malfunction."" . . . About two weeks after issuing its report, the safety center revised its findings and said the accident resulted from the failure or malfunction of an ""undetermined component of the engine.""

Tell me that doesn't reek of Admiral Daddy swooping in to save his son's career.  Dude had affluenza for days and still rose to the highest levels of government because we only allow rich kids to fail upwards."
15281,I thought dismissal of nuance was a Republican thing? You sure you aren't one?

15285,"My favorite moment was in the John Birch Society episodes where they repeated shout ""GIVE ME MONEY!!"" every time it's obvious that's the only goal of what is happening. 

When I encounter that behavior in every day life I want to shout that but I know no one around me will know what I'm talking about and will likely seem insane"

15301,You can basically link every bad thing America has done to the rest of the world in the past half century to him.

15303,"Check out behind the bastards episodes on him. You uhhh....will be informed. Check out the episodes on Dr Kellogg as well, that dude was so fucked up. Corn flakes fucked up so many more peoples lives than you realized"
15304,He's the Forest Gump of war crimes!

15309,"It's an amazing podcast that covers everyone from Hitler to Saddam, and King Leopold the II to Steven Seagal. But his favorite people to talk about is L. Ron Hubbard and Nazis."
15310,"I don't think anyones hates him more than Hitchens did. Apparently he once took a smoke break during a funeral they were both attending, so that he wouldn't be counted amongst those in the crowd when it was Kissinger's turn to speak."
15311,The shortest way to sun it up would be to say he is a major war criminal. It's hard to summarize something that took the host so long to explain though in a quick post
15312,"Theres a 6 part podcast that goes into it. He helped Nixon sabotage the Vietnamese peace talks before the election. Under Nixon administration he and Nixon personally planned bombing target that the US military didn't even present to them as options, missions with unneeded civilian casualties. He eventually helped broker peace and got a Noble Prize along with his North Vietnamese counterpart, who looked down on the reward. He was also fairly sexist and disgusting, even by the standards."
15313,"One example of many: he was a supporter (and at least in the case of Chile, co-conspirator) of the coups d'etat and military dictatorships that spread throughout Central and South America in the 1970s. 

Tens of thousands of people were tortured and killed in camps, bodies dumped from planes into rivers, children stolen and given away under false identities."
15314,"""Hes a family man and i didnt take the time to actually look past the first page on google, how could he be bad man?"" Are you seriously that easily convinced?

15315,Just a brief one: he worked to sabotage peace talks that would have ended the Vietnam War much earlier so that his pal Nixon could get elected.
15316,"Sure thing. He:

* Sabotaged the peace talks in the Vietnam war to benefit Nixon and his own career. The war continued needlessly, with additional deaths on both sides.

* He favored bombing Laos and Cambodia, countries the US was not at war with at the time. To this day, people die in said countries due to ordinance going off.

* He was the mastermind behind the plan Condor, officially a plan to avoid communist expansion in Latin America. In practice, it meant that any reclamation for workers rights was met with torture and genocide across the continent.

He's done more, but reading on these should give you a good start."
15317,Because pod cast say bad!
15318,You definitely should trust your gut on that. It's tough but fantastic.
15319,"Totally valid. That being said, sometimes it's cathartic to have someone equally angry but hilarious hosting, who channels it by throwing bagels around the studio, trying to hit them with a machete."
15320,"A fair assessment! Thanks. Wtf we were supposed to be old cat and tiny dog ladies together when we got old. Dark humor: at least she didn't have to go through the ""old"" part!  Much love in weird times, mate."

15331,"No he worked for them as an informant and asset

How does a journalist work for the federal government?  That's not who pays journalists. Feds might be sources for a journalist, but the journalist doesn't work FOR the sources, unless of course they are a propaganda agent, which is often the case with journalists (see: Bob Woodward and his relationship to Alexander Haig and Thomas Moorer). Evans time as a war reporter for Cracked and Vice is simply more evidence he's a fed. You don't get access to these warzones without a relationship with the military or state department, plus Vice itself was founded by another fed informant, Gavin McInnis, and received early funding from state department cutouts"
15332,"No what explains those stories is that Robert Evans is an informant, so he is released intentionally by the police so that he can help them spy on and entrap left wing activists

He has admitted to working with the feds, and makes 400k a year doing a podcast. He is a fake anarchist and it's dangerous to follow him bc he's a police informant

15333,This man looks like a completely different person in every picture I've seen of him
15334,"It's probably from his years of working for Cracked. Several people from Cracked have gone on to do great journalist/news shows and they all have similar strains of humor. Personally I like it, but I certainly need to be in the mood for it.

The other two former Cracked guys that I know of are Cody Johnston on Some More News and Dan O'Bannon who is a head writer for Last Week Tonight with John Oliver."
15335,"I would still describe him as a libertarian, just not in the way that word is used in the US. Having someone like him on a major news/comedy network would be massively discrediting in the eyes of most media conglomerates"
15336,"I am not sure if you're insane or just quoting him, which quite funny."
15337,"Isn't Hims just Viagra and Cialis and such? Is that really ""snake oil""?"
15338,I think with a giant corporation like iheart that may be difficult. He's mentioned it can be an issue. But I don't know.
15339,[I saw an interview with Steven Tobolowsky recently about working with Seagal on Glimmerman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cUNU8GkMso) and it was just so quintessential narcissistic Seagal. Of *course* he wanted to change the entire premise of the movie at the last minute to indulge his bullshit. What a douche.
15340,"wait, what? Paul Schafer is a Bastard...  


deflated..."
15341,"Yep, my bad!  Thanks for the correction.  Very similar vibe."
15342,"Ooh I gotta check out that one. Patton was on The Dollop for the John Kellog episode, which was GOAT."
15343,"I mean... her name is killjoy so this is really on you for having the wrong expectations. 

But also she's great and I have a lot of suspicions about these opinions."
15344,"Yea I googled ""is BTB trustworthy reddit"" and the results were hilarious haha. Half of them were lefties that were like ""He pretends to be on the left, but he is actually *very pro-gun* blah blah blah basically a libertarian"", and others were like ""I liked his content at first but him and his guests are all hyper-leftist yes men/women, they make everything so political etc.""


Basically all boils down to ""his politics don't align with mine!"". And to be fair I love the show partially because my politics basically perfectly align with him. I'm about as far-left as you can be, but I love guns (while supporting gun control), and drugs/ legalizing them. I too like the idea of having a big piece of property out in the middle of nowhere at some point, wouldn't be the worst if it was some kind of commune with my friends lol. And I'm all for protesting/ rioting against Facism, which he seems to be very active in. He's actually inspired me to try to get more active in that kind of thing."
15345,"Uhhhh you seem to be missing a vital detail on point 2. 

He wrote a book series about a place he's never been that he never researched... AND CLAIMED TO BE THE CHARACTER IN THE FICTIONAL BOOK HE WROTE TO EVERYONE AROUND HIM IN GERMANY. That's why its strange and unusual.

 Point 3: I'm not sure how this is an issue?"
15346,Those seem like minor errors.
15347,">	I stopped listening after that one. The guest Propaganda is terminally annoying and while I appreciate Irish pronunciations are hard, there was no effort in attempting to get pronunciations correct for certain places/names.

I liked Propaganda in the Black Panthers episode, haven't listened to his other espisodes.

Robert states many time in his episodes with place names he can't pronounce that he apologizes for getting it wrong and/or brushes over it because it's a small part of the story. The only place he doesn't care to pronounce right are places in Britain because ""fuck the British"" lol."

15349,"When someone says stuff like

>They went certain directions to fit their views

about a highly nuanced topic like Chris Chan I always see that as a red flag tbh"
15350,"Yup. Generalizing a religion based on a stereotype. Imagine if that was towards Jews or Muslims, or Islamics, or Mormons, or Scientologists?"
15351,"I wonder if these same people have similar opinions about the US education system. US history classes are purposefully simplified and often intentionally misleading. Where is the bitching about this from the people who think Robert's podcast isn't ""100% historically accurate"" as if that was ever even possible anyway."
15352,"A random person on reddit said he *seems* *majorly austistic*? seems like a weird thing to grasp onto if there is no proof.

First of all, I have no issue with people with autisim.

second, I have been quite respectful of the podcast, not shitting on it, just saying that I find the host to make poorly timed and less-than-clever jokes.

Thirdly, I also am a regular listener to the podcast because I think it is informative and interesting, despite my opinion of his jokes being bad.

..what are you getting at?"
15353,"First adult book I read, when I was a 12 year old kid recovering from an appendectomy in the hospital. 

Now that I think about it, who the fuck brought me *that* book to read in the hospital? ""Here you go, son...a little light reading for you. (tousles hair) Now eat all your Jello""."
15354,"I own it. I found a paperback copy in a thrift shop when I was in high school. That was probably my first ""Book is better than the movie"" moment."

I would definitely recommend checking out the older episodes, it was one of my favorite podcasts."
15357,Looks like it might be available streaming on Amazon? Thanks for the recommendation!
15358,"Yeah, Mike and Aubrey are too agreeable with each other at times so conversations that could use more depth or research are just glossed over. I remember a lot of listeners were REALLY not happy with their take on the ACEs study because it was clear neither knew much about it."
15359,Agreed. I think his experience with seeing how his mother was mistreated due to her size affects his ability to be objective on the subject.
15360,"Idk how I read that wrong looking at the actual ep lol. Thanks, it is 132."
15361,"""I suggest you continue your deposition."""
15362,"Yeah I stopped listening to the 2003/04 ones recently when I fell a few weeks behind and realised it would be a pain to try and catch up.

The Formulaic Objection episodes were massive time eaters as well."
15363,"It made so much make sense in my head and explained the source of so many conspiricies i hear today, and gave me tools to combat them, at least in my personal life. Thats why i like listening to their old episodes. Finally found out what the fuck agenda 21 was about."
15364,I love hearing about people who get the same joy from sports as I.

15377,I laughed until my stomach hurt on that one!
15378,"Edited. Thanks - thing is, I KNEW that and somehow my brain just lumped them in together like that. I guess you could add the SNL connection as well if we're looking for more similarities."
15379,"That would be a lot of fun. They could do bad cop, stupid cop"
15380,"And if you're a fan of malls, I've heard great things about his new podcast, Mall Walkin'"
15381,"I know, I'm quoting Paul Rudd in the episode after he did it."
15382,"You'll have to give it a listen. It'll only stand out to regular listeners, but Chuck was being obstinate and argumentative in the episode. Almost like he doesn't really like Josh very much. It kinda felt like we got a look behind the curtain. 

By the next episode things were back to normal, they even did a listener mail where people were pointing this out and the hosts denied there is any issues. 

Just a little SYSK listener drama, lol."
15383,"yeah it was a lil awkward and tense but for a listener to say it shows that these guys, who have worked together for over a decade and are clearly involved in each other's personal lives (gone on vacations together, etc), dislike each other and that was how they really act is a bit much LOL kind of jumping the gun..."
15384,"Interesting! My coworker produced a bunch of Darknet Diaries episodes and he says Jack Rhysider is a dick. Some of his stories definitely make Jack seem like a shitty boss, at the very least. 

I wonder what other podcasts I enjoy have hosts that aren't as cool off mic?"
15385,"Tbh this is the whole point of the podcast - they take a topic they know little (or sometimes nothing) about, do a bit of research and explain the main ideas in layman's terms in like 40 minutes. I get the criticism about some factual inaccuracies but that's to be expected when they're just giving a chatty introduction to a topic."
15386,"Well that sounds great. I don't want expert levels of knowledge podcast, sounds boring"
15387,It's definitely a ~~breath~~ breadth not depth podcast. They try and cover a whole topic in 45 minutes. It's great trivia fodder which is why I love it
15388,"I'll give them a try them, sounds good"
15389,I also love TPWKY but it's not so laid back and more hardcore science
15390,Fair enough. I'm not trying to piss in anyone's Wheaties. It's my opinion from the times I have listened to them that information with any depth to it cannot be trusted. It's not a show I can recommend. I'm glad it provides you all with a positive experience.
15391,"About basic, searchable facts that require no nuance or understanding of the topic, yes."
15392,Just curious - what's your expert topic? And did they get things wrong or did they just stay super high level with the content?
15393,What expert are you? lol
15394,"It's always the ones that sound so boring to me, that I end up liking most when I give them the chance."
15395,I love all their fraud episodes! Especially Enron.
15396,"I mean, there's that, but even other podcasts I listen to don't go above like 3 short ad breaks for a 20min episode. The How Stuff Works breaks are just ridiculous by comparison"
15397,"For the most part it's all implied or almost said and an obvious nevermind, but I meant more the content of what they are saying and not what they literally say, and it's always just a quick split second comment so it's not a big deal. I didn't mean like cunt or fuck or a specific word. I think it might have happened when they got to the mud part on the woodstock one for example? I'm not sure though."
15398,"Right?!? The beginning of that episode really got to me. I watched all kinds of documentaries about 9/11, but hearing that woman was tough. Maybe cause it felt like I was on the other end of the phone or something."
15399,You're correct. thanks
15400,"I think you might have gotten the wrong impression.  I wasn't trying to be contrary in my reply, nor trying to remind you of anything or correcting you. Mentioning 99pi's broad definition of ""design"" and how well-nuanced they are wasn't meant as an argument or to patronize you. 

In fact, I was agreeing with you, and was merely expanding on the general conversation that is a Reddit thread.

I viewed it as a group conversing and adding on further explanation to the group, just like you added to the convo by bringing up 99pi's focus on design. I didn't see it as you correcting me regarding ""random topics"", nor as you reminding/patronizing me. Rather, I see it simply as you expanding and adding to the group convo."
15401,You're welcome! I've heard great things about *Dungeons and Daddies* as well. Gotta give that one a listen.
15402,"Oh, he's getting his own podcast? It felt like he wasn't a guest on The Bugle as often recently, and that would explain why."
15403,"Yep! I've been shocked how many people I've seen complain online about how they don't ""play D&D right."""
15404,"They're really loose with the rules because it makes for way better content. This of course pisses off a lot of hardcore DnD players, because they get pissed off about literally anything."
15405,"That just about killed me when it happened. I love how Travis didn't confirm or deny, just said that for a moment he felt as if it might have happened."

Really disappointing"
15410,Yeah. you're totally right. It just sucks so much. I fucking loved them so much. I don't ever think I've laughed so hard. I keep trying to catch that again but it's gone

15416,Oh man I see what you did there.
15417,"Yeeeep. Listened through the whole thing 3 times now and each time I catch something that I didn't notice before.

EVERY episode is relevant to the overall plot (except Thrown Away, the one with the garbage bags and the teeth. They say in one of their Q&A's that that one was written before everything was planned out)"

15419,More dismembered than killed
15420,Have you listened to the Star Wars one yet? It's unhinged. Although the Mountains of Dadness was pretty good. My brother introduced me to the podcast during lockdowns and I've loved it. Ended up finding a copy of the original lovecraft book and got it for my brother for Christmas!
15421,Thank you for not pointing out I wrote their and not they're :)
15422,"It's really difficult to keep things straight all the time especially with friends, and it gets a bit boring if you do. This is how mine and my friends adventures always were, lots of goofing around, and it was always fun, but I've always been curious how more ""serious"" groups play DnD, if that's even a thing.

We did play some horror games surrounding the occult that almost got a bit too dark and serious at times with people having to RP their characters mental issues, so something in the middle would be interesting "

We are a runaway train speeding towards it. The democrats apply the brakes, but the brakes are civil war era technology and can't actually prevent the crash, just gives you some time to think of your loved ones before you do.

It's a sloppy metaphor but at the end of the day the democrats don't want to fix those brakes and make them better either. They just like that they can campaign on the brake pulling."
15431,"I'm not trying to insult you or be mean, I'm being genuine here. Most of those people do not represent any of us, they're rich establishment neoliberal stooges.

lol"
15443,"I understand at least why you feel the way you do, and it seems you're like, halfway there to understanding where I'm coming from too. 

I of course see no problem in setting up a Marxist-Leninist style state, to me it seems the most historically proven structure to achieve successful national liberation and social and material progress while protecting from reaction both internally and externally, of course you disagree on account of the much publicized 'authoritarianism' though from my point of view there is nothing uniquely totalitarian or authoritarian about MList states, I find capitalist states and even social democratic states to be authoritarian or totalitarian too, except it manifests in very different ways which certainly makes it difficult to understand the MList state structure and behavior even without all the piles of lies, distortions, exaggerations etc that we've been fed about ""authoritarian communists"". There's no shortage of history showing that ""free and democratic"" capitalist countries can and will at any time become very authoritarian to any groups that meaningfully threaten the status quo. 

It's also crucial, in my opinion, to remember to look at the history and material conditions any given state is dealing with, even the most labor friendly and functional social democracies are built on top of centuries of colonial spoils and are beneficiaries of the current imperialist system where much of the unmaskable ""authoritarianism/totalitarianism"" is exported to underdeveloped countries in the global periphery (South America, Africa, SE Asia etc). Places like North Korea did not have this benefit, their situation was exactly the opposite - they were the hyper exploited colony of Japan since before the turn of the 20th century. 

I didn't get the impression the hosts made it seem as if North Korea was an ""exemplary country"", given the vast power imbalance between them and the USA, given the USA's interests in Korea were never aligned with the interests of the Korean people and given the brutal occupation and the setting up of a brutal military dictatorship that killed tens of thousands of Koreans before the war even started, I really don't see where the North can be found ""guilty"" of the ""things it had done"" (I would be interested in you clarifying exactly what you mean by this) without falling back on ""the evil commie north invaded the south"" line we all heard in gradeschool that this podcast proved quite false (and even Wikipedia mentions that S Korean attacks and border skirmishes were common before the official ""start"" of the war) or the wild exaggerations of defectors the S. Korean government pays to tell their stories.

>North Korea was an exemplary country and would still be if it weren't for US action.

I would also say that, while of course the DPRK was no 'exemplary country' (I'd argue there really isn't such a thing under the past and current conditions of our world) it was certainly not the dystopian caricature it's normally painted as in western discourse and it's undeniable that the US's invasion, war and ongoing occupation of the south have been inarguably one of the largest forces that shaped the country and the trajectory of the country since the 1950's. Also I imagine a lot of what you find unsavory about MList states are a direct result of the real life need for protection against imperialist meddling (which, as a blowback fan, it sounds like you already know comes in many more nefarious forms than just open military engagement).

Anyway, I appreciate the conversation, sorry if I came off as a little harsh in the first comment. North Korea has somewhat uniquely been slandered so outrageously due to its self imposed isolation (which of course was a direct result of the US's actions) making it hard for legitimate info to get out of the country and making it very easy for straight up lies to spread like wildfire in capitalist press, so I completely understand why someone omitting what you (and I in the past) consider absolutely damning ""facts"" would come off as being unusually biased towards the DPRK."
15444,"Hey friend,

That was not a comment about the ""equality"" of atrocities, rather that I realistically think that war brings out atrocities in most men. To say otherwise is typically misleading and is usually nothing more than moral fumbling to promote violence (also real weird you had to bring the ""equality"" of atrocities up)

Secondly, I thankfully do not have to justify being a leftist to you, strange reddit tankie, as I am well acquainted with terminally online Maoists arguing how its actually ok to kill lots of people. Anyone worth their salt in history can take a step back and recognize that the cold war was bad from a variety of different angles.

Keep it up tho, you guys always make actual convos on the left really difficult and I don't figure you'll give it up any time soon."

Oh, I forgot to mention, in addition to the calls, every week (except during the summer months) Ray would read out a brain teaser known as the Puzzler during the third segment (or as they called it, third half) of the show, and encourage listeners to write the answer in on the back of a $3 bill (or some other outrageous, often unrealistic item) and mail it to them. The previous week's Puzzler would be answered at the start of the second segment.

They also received a lot of mail. Sometimes it would have to do with cars, but often not. Most weeks, Tom would read a piece of mail on air (often having maybe proofread it once before, so we would hear both brothers' live reactions to it). Here's one of my favorite letters that Tom read: [The Andy Letter](https://youtu.be/skPDrR5RFog).

Also, these guys both graduated from MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), so for all of their self-deprecation, they often do know what they're talking about."

15490,"Officially it was a immunology and cancer immunology but the DFTD is a really interesting jumping off point. It was just my undergrad thesis and essentially just a lit review, but yeah it was a cool topic."
15491,"Wow that is just sad. Radiolab was the first podcast I ever listened to back in 2013. I listened religiously all the way until Jad left, when the wheels really fell off almost instantly. I just can't listen any more. It is now just a bad podcast."
15492,Well said.
15493,"He has 100s of hours of super in-depth content. I've probably only listened to 20% or so, and I've heard him say dozens of times that a study is weak or low evidence, and he had said dozens and dozens of time in the podcast to checkout the studies for yourself before you take anything. So maybe he screwed up a few times and forgot to mention that a study was weak or missed a contradicting study he should've mentioned... big fucking deal. 

It is really trendy on reddit to dislike Huberman for some reason. Maybe because he is so popular that it is now cool to hate him. It actually is pretty hard to find credible experts with nothing to gain picking him apart. Most of the people picking him apart seem to be dodgy and selling something.

It is idiotic to dismiss 100s of hours of extremely useful information because he made a mistake or omission a few times. Nobody is perfect."
15494,"There's a reason his disclaimer is that his podcast is separate from his teaching and research commitments at Stanford. To me, it's an admission that he's not an academic neuroscientist when he's on the podcast - he's a salesman who leverages his neuroscientific knowledge for profit."
15495,"I think the issue is how information is presented. It's super easy for the ave person to hear about all these in vitro or animal models where some supplement had profoundly beneficial affects on some biomarker and then jump to the next step of ""well I should start using this""

Anecdotal, but I have a handful of friends that subscribe to him and are all very well educated -- two working in biotech research (BS/MS) and some who are med students/residents.  The two in research really buy into it with dozens of supplements & aggressive intermittent fasting, the guys in healthcare seem to be much less. I have to extrapolate that the dude w/ way less background working in retail or marketing or whatever is more susceptible"
15496,"What I'm saying is individual studies aren't used for clinical decisions, and even a dozen studies still aren't, they need to be aggregated and scrutinized -- that's why we have meta analysis. Even those are subject to questionability, which is why readers have to interpret it for study bias/heterogeneity. You might not need a PhD for that but you definitely need a data/science background to understand the significance. But that's why we have medical/health colleges who scrutinize as a unit that something is efficacious and add it to their recommendations so the average person doesn't have to ""do their own research"" 

Googling a study is fine when it's Joe Rogan just freestyling something he remembers hearing...but Huberman is a really smart dude using legit research. The nuance of ""is this clinically efficacious"" is a way higher bar than can't be cleared just by Googling. A lot of the stuff he's showing is novel and being discussed at conferences, problem is the listener isn't there for that half"

you made him the rich pig he is. you should be happy!"

15524,"Lol, he said he liked the way DeSantis handled Covid by letting people keep their small business open. How is that a ""fascist"" take?

15529,"IIRC the exact quote is that he threw everything including the kitchen sink at it.  And that's just one of the things he used.  I don't ever recall him adovcating using it instead of the vaccine, but more of a ""also consider using this too...it worked for me at least"".

But alot of people never bother to learn anything beyond what can fit into a sound byte and then, ironically, those same folks try to talk about misinformation lol."
15530,"That's not really honest. He said ""This was what I did and it worked great for me. It knocked the virus right out."" He doesn't need to say ""and so should you"" for it to be an endorsement."

15533,Can you give me an example of a mainstream radial left idea?
15534,"I don't know, expelling lawmakers out of a legislature for protesting gun violence is almost political persecution. Book banning, hypothesizing impromptu period exams to see if women are pregnant or not (to see if they're evading abortion), Jewish conspiracy theories (""space lasers""), and a whole litany of crazy shit.

In all honesty, I'm not a fan of either party at all. In reality, corruption is the only bipartisan policy a la the vast sums of money being given to corporate entities and the military industrial complex. 

It's rotten all the way down to the core, and to think that it's solely the radical left or the radical right is laughable when your money and rights are being sold away to the highest bidder.

For decades the entire country has been run by a shadowy nexus of banks, corporations, the military industrial complex, and intelligence agencies. 

The right vs. left culture war is a smokescreen to keep the commoners at each other's throats instead of the inept leadership manning the helm of this S.S. Titanic."

People act like he is some indie project with just him and a friend. This is a corporate venture and can absolutely afford to do better. He just doesn't want to."
15544,why do you think hes smart enough the learn the basics of every single topic he covers and know whats misinformation and what isn't?

15556,Totes babe 
15557,"Because some of his guests shouldn't even be seen never mind heard. Rogan offers little to no pushback when he has the more ""intellectual"" guests on. I don't need to question if I'm right about something when he entertains any of the Daily Wire scum."
15558,Same
15559,"For pushing pseudoscience, conspiracy theories, and right-wing propaganda as legitimate by sprinkling ocean of garbage with occasional legitimate guest."
15560,"They scammed their Patreons. They stopped posting episodes on there, never released any of the extra shit they said they would, and then when they started getting flack about it, they just decided to delete it completely. They never have an explanation, and never apologized for anything. So they were just taking peoples money and never gave anything for it. 

They've also sent their rabid fans after innocent people, see the Brittanee Drexel fallout. They never apologized for that either. And that's not the only one. Also, serial killers do NOT belong on merch, and they had several T-shirt's with serial killers on them. 

And as a PA, I have become convinced after finding out more about what she supposedly did that she was never an autopsy tech. She was the prep tech, and nothing more. And, knowing her, I wouldn't be surprised if she tried to go to PA school and got rejected. QU is the closest program to us in MA, so I'm guessing she tried to go there. 

They don't listen to any criticism, even if it's constructive and not just ""haters"". They almost exclusively cover straight white women. They're just not good people."
15561,"Well, to start, there is no degree requirement for being an autopsy tech like she claims. None. All you need is your GED, and there aren't any ""training"" programs for it either. You learn on the job. There's school to be a mortician, but nothing for an autopsy tech. Then, she claimed she was going in during COVID to do autopsies, and as a PA working in MA, I don't know of any hospitals in the state that were doing autopsies during COVID. There's other minor comments she's made that made me pause while listening, but I cant remember specifics, just that they made me go ""huh? That's not right..."""

15569,"I don't disagree with you here but wanted to add an emotional lens as I've loved both of his podcasts and repeat HOR over and over when I head to bed.

Personally speaking, he doesn't have to be a journalist nor professional where presentation is concerned because he's so relatable to so many for the basic enjoyment and fascination with our history.

I feel podcasts are a fantastic medium showing how many ways there are to put out quality content and Duncan's way of doing so is fantastic the way it is."
15570,"I'd disagree with not including the French Revolution in that shortlist. While France wasn't on top for as long as the USSR or the US, the absolute dominance and subsequent influence of Napoleonic Europe on completely rewriting the face of Europe politically, culturally, legally, and militarily is frankly astonishing. None of what Napoleon did could've happened without the blast furnace that was the French Revolution, and that single event frankly defines the entrance of Europe (and thus soon the world also due to colonialism) into the modern era."
15571,"Mike Duncan doesn't really get good at podcasting until he gets to the French Revolution. All of the History of Rome is him slowly improving. 

In fact, Duncan recommends that new listeners skip the history of Rome and the first two seasons of Revolutions because they are just that bad. Start with France."
15572,"Thanks, now I have to listen to it again"
15573,"Nah, they'll claim the USSR was actually authoritarian capitalism. Don't bother."

I wish the Crusades bonus episode wasn't a bonus one, because that one, too, has some great lines.

""This is like your washing machine getting up and deciding it's going to go retake jerusalem. They're not supposed to be able to DO that.""

They never claim a definitive link, they simply assert that we know for a fact unwanted children are more likely to be abused and commit crime, and we know that every state recieved a mysterious crime drop 18 years after legalizing abortion, it's possible abortion reduced crime by causing would-be criminals to never be born."

I'm also not saying people, as individuals, are not responsible for their choices. They are. But I appreciate Maintenance Phase for making me check my initial gut reaction to data. I used to previously think that the data I consumed was objective. They spent copious amounts of time showing why the data isn't objective. And their whole goal is just to help people be nicer to fat people, and think about what holes exist in the research, and what biases or data is being ignored. They're not saying all fat people are healthy. That's an individual conversation between someone and their doctor. They are saying that fatness isn't a reason for you to go and tell them to talk to a doctor. They know they're fat, and their doctor, statistically, probably isn't helping. So why should I, a rando with no other insights to this person's health other than a visual indicator, which frankly could be caused by lots of things, comment on it? What good am I possibly adding to the conversation? And Maintenance Phase had made me reflect on how I show up with the fat people in my life, which I think is all the hosts are asking of me."

And that's without getting into the fact that losing weight is functionally impossible for like 90-95% of people (no country has EVER reduced its overall rate of obesity without like, a famine).

It's getting to the point where a fat person who shows up to the doctor with knee pain should be given a knee cancer screening first, X-rays second, and the doctor shuts their fucking mouth about weight.

Edit: I'm not sure I spelled it out correctly, but the *first time* the medical profession missed treatable fatal cancer because of a patient's weight should have been a severe wake up call for the entire profession, changing how they view weight and fatness.  That is an utter failure I put on the same level as executing someone later proved innocent."
15628,"I tend to agree with both of those thesis points and respect them being represented. My issue with them is exactly in the ""scientist that may not get exposure."" Scientific evidence doesn't really work like that. You gotta look at the evidence as a whole. While conflicting views are important, I don't think they are equipped to evaluate whether the alternative view is as valuable as they want it to be. 

On a more personal bias level, they seem to talk down on the exercise science and fitness community. There are many people doing great work (stronger by science, rp, Jeff nippard) while not citing nazis or hokum."
15629,"It's an extremely annoying trend to see people who have no medical training, no genuine experience within the field, and who have never once actually successfully treated a living patient a for any problem ever, think that they can make sweeping proclaimations about anything medical armed only with a few hours (at best) worth of pubmed searching."
15630,"I'm sure they do but I remember during an episode (the halo top one I think) they bring up erythritol with a kind of animated ""whatever in the world that is."" I'm not saying they need to know everything, but not knowing one of the most common non-nutritive sweetners indicates to me a lack of prior knowledge or research to fill in those gaps."
15631,Redefining unpallatable facts as prejudice. Tale as old as... I wanna say about 2010 or so?
15632,"I mean...yeah? Not all smoking cessation methods are created equal, and not all methods of losing weight are created equal. If you use a specific method to achieve a goal, and you don't achieve that goal, would you not at least consider that the method might be ineffective?

""Dieting"" is generally associated with fad diets. Fad diets are often ineffective because they're unsustainable over the long term and/or are based on junk science. Sure, you can lose weight fast by eating nothing but cabbage soup for a week, but what are you gonna do when the week is over? You haven't created any long-term habits or learned anything about nutrition. You'll gain the weight back, then lose it, then gain it, then lose it again, and over time the weight cycling will wreak havoc on your health and make it even harder to lose weight in the future."
15633,"> The ""sweeping conclusion"" they're opposed to the robust medical consensus (that obesity is bad for you) that contradicts their own fringe belief.

I don't think they actually have ever said this, the point they've been making over and over is that stigimatizing overweight people (as you are doing right now) is at best unhelpful and at worst actively makes things worse. This is an important point to make considering that there is no current treatment for obesity that actually works so obesity being bad for you or not is somewhat irrelevant."

I can't imagine defending it.

>And that they are successful is irrelevant, as I am sure you know a lot of successful people that are shitty, like Musk or Poutine or Trump

A kind of funny moment was when I was playing Watchdogs: Legion and I got so frustrated that I couldn't listen to the in-game podcasts and audio diaries while just walking about the world, so I muted the game and listened to Darknet Diaries while playing it instead."

He has an uncanny way of helping you visualize and appreciate the conditions and circumstances of the era, and you truly feel for the those people who lived it. 

Each episode of that series is more like an audiobook selection than a podcast. The production is phenomenal and the fact he charges a pittance for each episode is astounding.

Arguably the greatest podcast series ever."

15652," In the UK, both wars are covered in Primary School (ages 4/5 - 11) vaguely, then in a lot more detail later on (especially if you choose history for GCSE/A-level).

 I had a bit of a war history nut teacher when the subject was being covered though, and he went into far, far more detail than he probably should have or was probably appropriate for kids of that age.

 Loved every second of it.  Carlin's podcast reminded me of his kind of passion and interest in the human side of the conflict.

 As such I was already aware of the brutality and absolute insanity of the war, but the political side was a welcome expansion."
15653,"I think what astonished me about the WWII series was the scope of te conflict, just how viscous the fighting was, and the relative insignificant of the western front."
15654,"Oh for sure. I tend to judge entertainment value per $ sometimes for like video games and other media. A series like blueprint for armageddon is like 20-25 hours for 15 dollars. Pretty good deal.

Even sicker deal that they are free for a bit until they get archived."

At the start of WWII we didn't know about the concentration camps and genocide going on."
15659,"I really picked a random publicly known figure that came before the year 2000, that's still recent enough and has a split opinion. I can assure you I don't know enough about Reagan to make a narrative in that direction. 

Not saying you were unfounded, I see why you would say that. 

I firmly believe we don't teach a lot of recent stuff so that schools or individual teachers don't have to take a stance on issues currently dealt with, did your experience differ? 

We had a government class in high school, and our teacher tried very obviously hard to not say one way or another which party she thought worked better through any given years."
15660,"WWII was an even more gruesome waste of even more life, but we LOOOVE that story. Probably because you're right, there might not be a full-scale war in all of history that had such clear-cut lines of bad guys and not bad guys. It was very dramatic, an epic struggle of good vs. evil and it was very morally uncomplicated in terms of who was in the right and who was in the wrong."

15663,"All of Europe was itching for a fight. It was going to happen regardless of whether Franz Ferdinand was assassinated.

The advent of technology and modernisation of armies made everyone excited to see just what they could achieve by dominating another country and that led to all leaders, be they German, French, British, etc throwing their peoples lives into a meat grinder where thousands, hundreds of thousands of lives were lost for the gain of 50 yards. All the whilst deploying more and more shelling, mustard gas and other atrocities."
15664,May I present: [If WW1 was a bar fight](https://blogs.reinhardt.edu/history/if-wwi-was-a-bar-fight/)
15665,"See this just shows how little Americans actually know about WWI. The sinking of the Lusitania was a retroactive explanation for why we entered the war, it's a total falsehood to claim it as any real reason for our decision. The Lusitania was sunk in 1915 and we didn't enter the war until 1917. Additionally, when Wilson ran in 1916, just a year after the sinking, he won on a campaign of keeping america out of ""Europe's war"" 

Read into the Nye Committee and the merchants of death for the real reason as to why we entered. We had loaned France and the UK too much money for us to comfortably watch from a distance. We were pretty much taken into war against popular will by bankers and arms dealers... a proud American tradition."
15666,"That's probably true, but I'm non American and it's a very similar story taught. I guess not wanting to admit that the winners (us) were also the bad guys is partly to blame"
15667,"I bet if you went into a public high school today and ask a hundred kids which country dropped atomic bombs on populated cities of another nation, well over 75% of them would get it wrong. Hell you can even make it multiple choice.

Edit: wrong bomb type. This isnt The Island"
15668,"No, I didn't learn about that in school either. I know about it now. But my original comment was about the US,"
15669,I'd argue the Vietnam War was more the product of unlearned lessons than a producer of them. A lot of things changed after Vietnam.

15677,"My point is that Carlin, realistically speaking, is not a scholarly historian, but nor is he dumping infotainment in a lazy or careless way. That's the point I was trying to get across.

>I don't get what's ""centrist"" about your suggestion that historians are too sensitive about laypeople understating the difference between their work and his.

The point is that they shouldn't be sensitive when Carlin himself clearly reiterates he is not a historian. Moreover, he routinely makes it clear when he is filling in gaps rather than making shit up as though it were fact like a Chat GPT session.

>Do you think you and your mechanic are similarly informed because you listened to Car Talk for 20 years of weekends?

Again, I wasn't claiming they were on level footing, hence the post, but I also would rather someone who has listened to 20 years of *Car Talk* trying to figure out what's wrong with my car than someone who thinks that blinker fluid is real.

>""I listen to this because it's fun and interesting, but I know better than to jump into a conversation (or god forbid an argument) with only facts from the podcast"".

You remind me of those chess gatekeepers who get annoyed when you watch non-professionals play just because they're popular rather than on chess merit. You can still learn a lot from people who aren't at the absolute apex of their field. The important thing to remember here is, for the third time, that Carlin *clearly* mentions when he is creatively filling in gaps through speculation. He isn't ""making shit up"" and then passing it off as real. In any case, the retelling of history is always weaved as an interpretive sketch, and to act like Carlin's knowledge of history is superficial or grossly inaccurate is a completely disservice to his excellent shows."
15678,"4 pages of footnotes for every page of prose examining every optional opinion that has been put forward.  Sure it is accurate, but at what cost?  Dan presents a story that is as accurate as possible while fully admitting to the potential weaknesses of that approach.

His popularity says a lot more than the criticisms of a few historians."
15679,">They're critically examining sources to the tinniest detail to paint an accurate picture, while he tells an entertaining story.

Are these mutually exclusive? Basically do the minutiae necessarily give you a better idea of what happened and why?

I ask this honestly because I've changed my personal opinion over the years as someone who thought the minutiae mattered once upon a time, I've transitioned over to it being way more important that you have a broad understanding of what happened because every single story has its bias outside of specific objective dates, times, and other quantifiables (which even then can be largely mistaken)

Even reflecting on recent history, I was literally present within modern black lives matter protests  from the 2020s only to read later how the story was written about the event were pretty fabricated lies according to what will likely be cited by future historians.  

And even then, my story is just one in a sea of millions of other human stories that are all going to conflict in various ways."
15680,"lol... now, ironically, I am downvoted and you're upvoted... god, redditors can be so fickle sometimes."
15681,"Lots of people in this thread talking shit about him as if everyone has the time or motivation to read all the material from professional historians instead. Dan makes it accessible for everyone in a way that people enjoy. If the genius historian or folks over at AskHistory take issue with it, they should make their own podcast that is just as good as Dan's.

I swear, it's like they'd rather people have no knowledge or interest in a subject than have people who have a broad overview with a few minor errors/misconceptions that can be addressed if they learn new information."
15682,"That's how Dan uses them most of the time. It's not like he's above reproach, I just think a lot of the criticism I'm seeing goes too far."
15683,Ok.
15684,"His sources are published historians, many of them. You're actually arguing that reddit is a better source of historical accuracy than actual published historians?

Make it make sense"
15685,"That's not what I think at all, I think he literally quotes more qualified historians than are on reddit. The books he quotes are where those reddit historians got their knowledge in the first place.

They can definitely disagree with his interpretation but that's not what I asked."

I imagine when teaching it's best to go with broad themes that kids can understand. But a four part series on say, the Rwandan genocide is much more interesting than the two-line description that a textbook would give. There's so much cool history out there that I would've loved as a kid."

The plan worked too well and Stuff You Should Know sold to iHeart with inflated value from the Western Division.

Robert made his own Network within iHeart called Cool Zone Media but outside of when the Washington State Police ran ads on his show he doesn't have a problem taking iHeart's money because they leave him alone and probably facilitate guests like Paul F Tompkins and David X Cohen."

It would be the same is Nestle paid for ads with him, or if he played an Ad for Alex Jones' podcast, or something from Scientology... where your money comes from matters and if you take your money from them, then you are supporting them.

There were also many books about asia or africa (some of which sparked the interest in africa which led to the coloniasation of the continent), most of which were written by people who never left their homecountry.

 The claim that he was old shatterhand was much much later. Imagine JK Rowling claiming in 30 years to be hermoine and in 100 years someone makes a podcast and says it's weird how there was a popular wizarding book in which the author claims to be a real life witch. Or claim it's weird that people let children read a book in which wizards shit themselves and then teleport the shit away.

Even on actual books written on a historical subject, you can't include every bit of info and context. You have to decide what context is absolutely necessary to understand and what is superfluous, even if the additional context might provide more insight. You have to fill in blanks to the best of your ability, you have to create a narrative structure of sorts out of the chaos of history. Many historians spend their whole academic careers specializing in a chunk of history that is only a few decades or even years long. There's no way to condense all that info into a single text without cutting things and streamlining things. 

That doesn't mean that it's always okay, clearly when you're cutting stuff that's a huge door for personal bias to come into play. Or your thoughts on what's more important doesn't align with broader research.

Actual historians have their work peer reviewed to point out things that should've been included, or things that were unnecessarily included, fix errors and flaws, etc. But you're just not going to get that in a comedy podcast, and it's silly to expect it"

The whole thing led them to turning him Blue and from refraining from describing any of their characters in the future and just letting fanart decide.

Yeah, technically you could say it's 199 episodes of plot and 1 episode of filler due to this. But it's a well written episode and if you're really determined, you can kind-of make it fit.

I know it was originally intended to introduce >!The Flesh, before they radically changed how The Flesh worked.!< but you could argue it sort of serves as an introduction for >!The Eye.

Your comment very much came off as an attempt to equivocate people fighting for their freedom with the people who were attempting to brutally subjugate them, my apologies if this wasn't your intent however you have to see how your words could easily be construed that way, 

>""both Americans and North Koreans committed atrocities rather than one or the other.""

seems to very much imply the atrocities committed are somehow similar or on comparable levels.

>I realistically think that war brings out atrocities in most men. To say otherwise is typically misleading and is usually nothing more than moral fumbling to promote violence

Well of course, war is atrocious and always leads to atrocities of some sort or another, I figured this was common knowledge for the both of us. That's the reason I thought you were trying to equivocate intentional US atrocities (which were largely structural and or purposefully decided policy) with common war time atrocities, which came off as functionally downplaying not just the truly horrific shit the US leadership decided to do, but excusing the US's initial aggression towards the Korean people that *started the war* in the first place. 

Just strikes me as incredibly weird. Like if someone was talking about the truly heinous atrocities committed by the nazis in WWII and someone brings up ""Well every side committed atrocities"" - Would you consider that downplaying nazi atrocities? I feel like I would. 

>Secondly, I thankfully do not have to justify being a leftist to you, strange reddit tankie

Oh jeez, unironic use of the term tankie. I can't imagine there's any hope of actually having a conversation with you since your mind is already fully made up but maybe other people will see this convo and gain something from it.  

>I am well acquainted with terminally online Maoists arguing how its actually ok to kill lots of people.

Oh I've seen a few of those Maoists, can't say I agree with them or Maoism in general (assuming you're talking about 'Gonzalo Thought' Maoism) most MLists I've seen abhor those types as well. Killing lots of people is generally not ok, which funny enough is why extant Maoists don't exactly have the backing of the masses in Peru at the moment.  

>Anyone worth their salt in history can take a step back and recognize that the cold war was bad from a variety of different angles.

Certainly, but anyone worth their salt in history can also clearly see (as illustrated in the case of Korea and Cuba, two countries showcased in the podcast we were discussing) that there was a very clear aggressor in the cold war, a very clear leader in the committing of atrocities around the world, and it wasn't the communists. 

>Keep it up tho, you guys always make actual convos on the left really difficult and I don't figure you'll give it up any time soon.

I'll keep it up as long as I can, with so many liberals masquerading as leftists on the internet it's important to counter pro-imperialist narratives that are basically pre-loaded onto everyone who grew up in the US. I apologize if this is difficult for you, it was for me too basically finding out much of my knowledge of history had been heavily skewed by cold war propaganda, oftentimes learning new things that challenge your previously held beliefs is incredibly difficult. For instance, you listening to Blowback season three, noticing a distinct lack of North Korean atrocities and instead of considering maybe there simply were not any comparable atrocities your initial gut reaction is to assume the hosts were taking a firm DPRK apologist stance, not the impression I got at all. 

Anyway, have a nice day!"

Any of the podcast descriptions that list scientists, doctors, engineers, or historians. A 2-3 hour format allows these people to open up and dive deep into the nuances that we don't even think about. They can be very insightful.

He also has controversial people on too, which honestly is just a window into these people's lives, love them or hate them. Some people can't handle that without raging, though.

I personally stay away from his UFC episodes because I'm not that into the sport, but he's really passionate about that subject, and some people just like listening to other people explain things they're passionate about (I follow someone on YouTube, for example, who's passionate about flashlights/torches and knives, and I've never purchased either).

He'll also have celebrities on, comedians, journalists, politicians, etc. and that's really just pick one if you think it'll be interesting to you personally. It's all subjective anyway, as to what you may like. There's a few websites that select several episodes based on subject. Also, maybe try asking Bing Chat/chatGPT for episodes based on any of these topics that interest you."
15833,"Depends on what your into really. He's done so many, he has a bit of everything. Google his popular episodes and pick out one that catches your interest. If you like it branch out a bit, you can learn so much from these. He is  very good at interviewing"

15835,"> Didnt know it was the biggest. Guess their guests are worth a watch. Any recommendations?

That's honestly kinda the beauty of it.  It's not a targeted one subject podcast.  It has guests from all types of interests and life and views and beliefs on.  It's better for you to just look through the episode history and pick out guests you think you'll like yourself.

You've got various types of athletes and MMA, comedy, and quasi political people, but you've also got people who've devoted their life to charity, came from other countries, scientists in various fields, people who specialize in specific native american tribes, historians, painters, former refugees, musicians, etc.  He's also had major named guests like elon musk and mike tyson, and despite how much progressive/left leaning folks hate him he ""platformed"" Bernie Sanders and talked him up and said he really liked him on the podcast.  Bernie himself enjoyed the conversation and felt fairly treated, and ironically Bernie Sanders fans got angry at BERNIE for that.  (politics never does make much sense, its mostly just unfiltered illogical emotion these days across the board, a battle of religions.)

It's basically the equivalent of an all you can eat buffet where you walk up and pick what you like and most of the food is very very good but maybe you'll not like 15% of the food...but you prolly already know what you don't like.

&nbsp;

Much of reddit doesn't even watch him, or hate watches him, and talks shit because of like 15% of his guests.  Precisely because he has a little bit of everything on, which means people who want you to not hear specific things get crabby when he has guests that talk about those things on...and then argue when he has other guests that has their specific views on that they didn't get enough time or talking space or etc.  Because they're trying to control the food at the buffet and make their favorite food a larger share lol."

15854,"> I mean, you're only proving my point.


That you've been radicalized by reddit and this has compromised your everyday viewpoints?  Yes, I think it does prove that point.  It's kinda funny.  People started talking shit about Facebook and how it's radicalizing people...and I agree.  But then they're doing the same thing on reddit completely oblivious.

&nbsp;

So let's say ""you're only proving my point"" is right here.  Do you realize how badly you've undercut your own argument?  Because by accepting what I've typed there you're confirming that your own perspective has been radically changed.  ERGO your judgements on what is good/bad and funny/unfunny have been radically changed.

That comedian or person doesn't have to have changed in the slightest for you to think they are better/worse, because you now approach the world very differently.

&nbsp;

You mistakenly thought this was a 1:1 parallel because you do not understand the context of the conversation.  Me and you were ""talking"".  My original comment suggested/implied extremely heavily that the person being criticized never changed, that you did.  And then by saying that I proved your point you confirmed that.

The parallel by definition cannot be correct in this situation because you are not a control.  It ceases to be a parallel when you're not long a control, a constant.  The whole point of the parallel is the idea that your views stayed the same and that they changed and the fact your views remained steady allows you to notice the difference between their old and new state.  But if your views and how you approach things have radically shifted we can no longer assume they changed because we're no longer measuring from the same point anymore.  

&nbsp;

And so I'll state my original premise you've now unwittingly supported quite bluntly.  Joe didn't change and get worse, YOU did, and because how you see the world has changed you now perceive him as worse despite him being the same idiotic meathead calling himself an idiot you shouldn't listen to that he always was.

Your perspective changed so much, that you started listening to the meathead telling you that he was an idiot and you shouldn't listen to him.  Because it now serves your new perspective on the world.  Ironically, in that sense, Joe Rogan is alot smarter than you.  He knows he's an idiot not to be trusted and openly says this on air.  You started taking him seriously anyways hahahaha."
15855,"This is so funny lmao. You have sunk deep into the ""well if YOU know so much..."" insults. I did some surface level research to see one of his guests was a complete sham, research even you could do yourself, and you're immediately so taken aback that you feel personally attacked and instead resort to insulting me.

 Robert Malone is a hack and Joe could have easily seen that before inviting him on. Joe could have still invited him on and given him the chance to speak while also countering his claims. Joe did not counter him. Joe willingly chose not to.

Fox news rakes in tons of views, does that make it a valid news source and justify its misinformation?

Numbers mean nothing. We aren't discussing how popular JRE is. We're discussing how accurate it is.

Your entire argument right now is predicated on this stance of ""To be popular and successful you must be wrong and misinforming!""

Like bruh.

Edit: Yeah, block me. Predictable. Smarter than Rogan if I'm able to debunk Malone with none of the resources Rogan has. Cope that an average person can do Rogan's job better than him in that regard, I guess."
15856,"Joe is suppose to vet his guest before hand, and he is suppose to have a fact checker on hand (pull it up Jamie) but both of them never bother to actually do their due diligence. In the event a guest says something wrong, Joe needs to immediately jump in and correct. In my opinion, you should not have a large media voice without stringent fact checking. I don't think Joe is bad person, he's just very irresponsible with his platform. He needs to stick to comedy, he ain't no Bill Burr or Carlin who can say deep things. He's suggestible and irresponsible. I'm just asking for pressure to be put on him and Jamie to be better or face consequences."

15877,I'll agree with that 100%. The first few episodes are hard to get through (almost like the first act of Red Dead Redemption 2). But if you stick with it you're greatly rewarded with some of the best material out there.
15878,"Yeah I wish he could go back and do the first two again with the depth he did the later series (I think he said as much).  All the same I think they are important for context.  Just the point that the English ""civil war"" has precursors to everything we'd be talking about in the American,the French and the Russian revolutions is not something enough people know about."
15879,Have they posted that live show yet?
15880,"That's fair, I just went in assuming it was going to be different and was surprised. It's all subjective though, so to each their own!"
15881,"I would assume the other person who is just now discovering the podcast would care to know someone's experience. That's generally a pretty common thing people are interested in when making a decision to try new media. Of course, they could disagree with me and that's cool too.

You're right that I don't need permission to not listen to a podcast, but it sure as shit seems like I need permission from *you* to give my opinion to someone who isn't you. Weird."
15882,Thank you!
15883,"I didn't know the story at all, and the Cautionary Tales episode about it was fantastic because it profiles both Kamen and the eventual CEO who goes off the cliff. I forgot his name too, lol, but they profile two inventions, one successful and one is the Segway."
15884,Truly the greatest invention since fire.

I get you, but even so..."
15886,"Either that or *three* walls, forming two corridors. Then we could call them the British Aisles."
15887,YES. Same for top gear. Good point. They're all spending their time how I would choose to if I had free time and friends lol
15888,"And I'm saying I think you could
Maybe make an argument about his intent being towards all those things, he failed to do any of that successfully.

EDIT: Looking back over things, there's so much horrible philosophy baked into the book that in my opinion it just overshadows any kind of basic finance stuff you viudo take away"
15889,"It is from blink, it's pretty much the main point of the book (although that one's not much better then freakanomics)"
15890,Yeah I think it was. I might be confusing it with the bit in freakonomics about the large amount of stop and search of black people. Unless that's also another MG book.
15891,"He has some interesting episodes of revisionist history I think it is called, but he is such an insufferable asshole to listen to that gets high on his own farts. Also he sells out and creates an entire season dedicated to the immense beauty, feel, and soundtrack to the new lexus! Get yours today!"
15892,He does have a very readable writing style though.
15893,"I had no idea why people loved his shit.  I bought both Freakonomics and Blink and stuff expecting to be enlightened and I was like, how are these great arguments?  I really felt like I was missing something.  There were some entertaining anecdotes but the conclusions drawn didn't seem to match the evidence given.

However, I felt something similar while reading ""The World is Flat"".  I found that book difficult to get through.

I started to feel non-fiction just wasn't for me.  Then I picked up Ben Goldacre's Bad Science and quite enjoyed that."
15894,"Well I wouldn't say that he sucks, I like the stories he tells but factually I'm a bit sceptical these days."
15895,I know a ton of grad students that also play instruments...but guitar is like learning how to ride a bike.
15896,"Yeah, the book is fine because it's very aware of what it is: a pop Econ book. It's meant to be an accessible book that looks at some selected data and asks readers to think a little differently about it. It's meant for a casual reader who otherwise has no background in economics. The problem is people reading it and thinking they suddenly understand economics. 

Also, it's about 20 years old now."
15897,"Exactly why I love the podcast (and probably why so many here seem to hate the book). They never outright tell you what to believe, or what the *right* answer is. They usually just present a couple sides of the argument and then the listener gets to decide how they feel on the topic."
15898,"It's really too bad that the segments are set up the way they are --- they hustle people along before letting the audience realize how deep the questions really are. The names issue really is a window into the depths of inequality in the US. When studies of discrimination based on racially-perceived names are carefully analyzed over time, it turns out that racial discrimination in job hiring has basically not changed at all over time:

[https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1706255114](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1706255114)

This is such a deep contrast with the beliefs many Americans hold about racial progress that it's shocking to people. The results aren't explained away by class perceptions of names, but even if they were this would be a second interesting question (why people have strong class stereotypes about different races).

It truly isn't hard to get people to see the interesting dimensions here, but the Freakonomics angle is usually much shallower, which I find disappointing."
15899,"Unfortunately, it seems that it often shuts down thoughts more than provoking them. Do people come away from this wondering why there is a stereotype that Black names are connected with poverty, or do they come away believing that resume audits are ""solved""? My experience from teaching undergrads for a long time is that it's almost always the latter. Which is too bad. These sorts of pop books often teach people not to think too much about interesting questions, which is why I think they're a shame."
15900,Then it shouldn't present itself as a research paper.
15901,"They're discussed in the book.  If I'm remembering right, most of the book was in that sort of format -- ask interesting question, give some reasons to think there's some connection there, then provide a counterexample.  Then some conclusion attempting to quantify."
15902,"While Freakonomics does spend a lot of time discussing abortion in the US, they cite the Polish abortion study as one of their big sources for abortion reducing crime, even though the Polish study found the opposite to be true.

As for their US-centric data, my understanding is that while some states do show a correlation, other states that banned abortion around the same time do not. There was not a clear correlation.

And yet, the Freakonomics author's claimed (even recently) that an abortion/crime link could explain ~50% of the crime drop. That's a huge assertion to make on such shaky results. Cherry-picking data from a few states and extrapolating is not sound science.

I believe the Polish study found that outlawing abortion most significantly reduced middle/upper class abortions, whereas poorer people did not have the means or money to get an abortion even when it was legal. Thus, the unwanted children that were spared by the abortion ban were more likely to come from more well off households that could still afford to raise a child, even if they didn't want to.

Put another way, a lot of poorer parents that had unwanted children were still having the child even when abortion was legal."
15903,"Not every state experienced the same drop and states which legalized abortion in phases over many years experienced a drop in one go rather than slowly over time as ""generation"" 1, 2, 3 etc came of age. Doesn't really work. I actually heard a social science professor say that improvements in divorce/family law had a far far larger impact than abortion."
15904,"While Freakonomics does spend a lot of time discussing abortion and crime in the US, they cite the Polish abortion study as one of their big sources for the claim that abortion reduces crime, even though the Polish study found the opposite to be true.

Their US data does not show a clear link between the two, it's just a correlation that is not consistent across all states."

15910,Always has been.  There are just too many variables that go into what determines a persons weight. And not all foods are created equal. The most problematic aspect is the dogmatic culture around it. But honestly it's probably one of my least favourite things to discuss because of that. Fat studies has a solid footing in the academic world at this point so there is plenty of research out there for you to peruse if you are interested.
15911,"I agree their health issues should be Ken seriously but I also believe obesity causes many of the health issues. Someone I love dearly has multiple health issues that would all be helped by her losing a substantial amount of weight. It's heartbreaking watching her slowly killing herself. 
That said I don't know anything about this podcast."
15912,"Did you, at any point in your offensive, self-righteous rant, pause to think ""did this guy actually do any of the things I'm accusing him of?""?"
15913,"Your experience is just one experience. Many people gain weight and lose weight. But your experience is not the same as someone who has been obese for decades, and you shouldn't speak down to those people either by presuming that what worked for you would take exactly the same effort or have the same effect for them."
15914,"They don't spout that it's impossible. They present that yo-yo dieting doesn't work. Extreme diet changes lead to weight loss yes but keeping it off is another story. I would say their main thesis is that if you are eating healthy, are physically active and are still fat, which is a reality for a lot of people, then that's okay. You shouldn't be pressured to go on extreme diets that will cause more harm than good all for the sake of being skinny."
15915,Just because you lost weight as an adolescent doesn't make it possible or feasible for everyone else wherever they are in life. The podcasts main message is that fat people want to be able to go on with their lives without everyone constantly bringing up their weight.
15916,No one said it's not possible. And your take is really offensive. You have every opportunity to educate yourself on the topic.
15917,"You have to have self-esteem, sure, but you absolutely do not have to accept the fact that you're way overweight. In fact, I think you need to understand that that's a hindrance in your life before you can get over it. That's what made the change in my life."
15918,[deleted]
15919,But... that's why we're fat?
15920,"Lol is this satire? Man this one is hard to tell honestly

Saying there's any way to gain weight without *eating more calories than you burn* is just hilarious to me since it's such a simple physics problem"
15921,"Upvoting you back to ""0"", brother. I'm with ya 100%, pretending like there's nothing to be done about one's own eating habits because ""society exists"" is pathetic as fuck."
15922,Internet becoming soft
15923,"I'll watch it when I can, but I seriously doubt it's ""more complicated"" than whatever you want to claim. When talking just about weight management, it literally is just as simple as caloric intake.

How do I know this? Well, because I am a human being and I noticed that when I was eating a bunch of food and drinking sugary drinks that I was gaining weight, then, when I controled my diet that I lowered my weight. Very simple stuff. It literally does not require much of any knowledge. However, if it really concerns you to have ""science"" and you need ""studies,"" then here's an article for you:

15924,"Yeah, I didn't need a podcaster to tell me not to randomly walk up to fat people and demean them, but I'm glad you learned to not be a jerk, I guess?

While I can agree with not being a jerk to someone you don't know. I also think there should be societal stigmatism against such self-destructive health behaviors (which is putting more and more of a strain on our healthcare systems as these fat people cause more and more of their own health issues that spiral more and more out of control).

Edit: also, I would like to point out how the podcasters and you keep bringing up the ""individual"" and how the ""calories in, calories out"" advice doesn't wholly translate into personal health.

To which I agree! Health is an individual effort. It is on you to care for your health. This is why it is likely the fault of the individual for being lazy and not addressing their individual health situation to ensure they are living healthily.

It really just boils down into you need to put effort into your body."
15925,"If you're seriously offended by the term ""fatty"" then you're the one with the (presumably weight related) problem

I used to be a fatty (morbidly obese) and throwing pity parties for myself about how unfair the world is was self-destructive, not helpful"
15926,"Nah, I just speak the hard truths."
15927,"Just ignore the meat of the comment, lol. You must be obese."
15928,"It goes both ways, too. I had a friend who had a hell of a time getting doctors to take him seriously about potentially having sleep apnea because he wasn't overweight. Once he finally got in for a sleep study months later, yup, sure enough, severe sleep apnea."
15929,"If the doctor does nothing to at least try to improve patient's health outcomes by getting them to lose weight, then they failed their job

Just like if I go in for a routine check up, and mention that I smoke, my doctor should be telling me to quit smoking, not ignoring it because ""quitting smoking is hard and most people don't do it successfully"""
15930,"Functionally impossible to lose weight, hahahaha. What a sick joke. Put the Big Mac down & go for a walk."
15931,"Yeah I agree with all of that. And it's all very different from the point you seemed to be making with your ""patient shows up the to ER with critical symptoms"" examples."
15932,">My issue with them is exactly in the ""scientist that may not get exposure."" Scientific evidence doesn't really work like that. 

That's totally fair, and I should probably clarify what I mean by that. I'm not referring to the whole ""lone rogue scientist whose research isn't accepted by the mainstream scientific community!"" narrative that pops up a lot (in fact those are the kinds of stories they end up spending more time debunking). I'm referring more to a situation where a group of scientists publish a paper saying *something* (there's a correlation between *x* thing and *y* thing, etc.), with all the nuance, complications, and caveats you might expect from an academic paper, then a science journalist writes a piece on that paper, then a mainstream journalist writes a piece on *that* piece, then late night talk shows pick up on it and make jokes about it, and then it starts getting spread as a meme of Facebook and Reddit and by the time it becomes ""common knowledge"" it has been diluted and warped from a complex and contextualized scientific inquiry into an easy to remember rule of thumb that isn't actually representative of what the original paper was about. And in the mean time, those same scientists may have further qualified what they wrote with new information and no one in the public has heard about it yet.

More often than not their conclusions aren't ""everyone believes *x* thing about health, but it's actually the opposite!"", but are instead ""everyone believes *x* thing about health, but it's actually just *way more complicated than that* and can't be generalized as much as it is."""
15933,">armed only with a few hours (at best) worth of pubmed searching.

So far as I know, Michael Hobbes is a professional journalist who spends weeks/months researching episodes and Aubrey Gordon is an activist who has worked in this space for many many years, so I'm not sure that's a fair summary of their research process."
15934,"There are trained medical professionals who have come to the same conclusions as the podcsst- particularly regarding the BMI, which was actually not developed by health professionals at all. Their podcast is ""debunking the junk science behind crash diets and wellness fads"". So, tbf, a lot of what they're debunking comes from individuals who ""have never once actually successfully treated a living patient for any problems ever and think they can make sweeping proclamations"". They're not anti weightloss- Aubrey Gordon, a fat activist, talks openly about the fact that she has lost some weight and speaks about her various experiences intentionally dieting and going through weight loss programs. They just don't think being thin should be the standard fat people have to meet to access competent medical care and empathy. That really shouldn't be as radical an outlook as it clearly is."
15935,I agree with all this. But they're opposed to the belief that weight should or even can be sustainably changed. That's what I'm objecting to.
15936,"1) You're - I suspect without even noticing - employing the same rhetorical slight of hand they do where you conflate the claim that a disease is bad with the claim that people living with it are bad.

2) Point out where I stigmatised overweight people.

3) They've asserted obesity doesn't increase mortality and pretty much ignored the direct detriment it has on quality of life (joint pain, fitness, etc.)

4) Diet is an effective intervention for weight loss, but that should go without saying."

Blueprint to Armageddon is incredible, but the episode that hooked me in was a shorter one called ""Prophets of Doom"" about the aftermath in the city of Munster during the protestant reformation. It's a subject I knew nothing about and cared about even less. Dan's synthesis of the events made the whole situation feel alive, interesting, and relevant, cementing the timeline of events and names of major characters from the 17th century in my mind effortlessly."

15947,"Another great series of his is Ghosts of the Ostfront, about the Eastern front in WWII.  Similar horrors to the Western front of WWI, but on a larger scale.

I took a memorable hike on a winter evening while listening to Ghosts of the Ostfront, it was the perfect setting.  Hoofing it up and down through cold, muddy, rocky terrain while listening to a narration of German soldiers doing the same thing 80 years ago, first eastward, then westward in greatly diminished numbers and conditions.  It was haunting and stuck with me."

15952,Yeah. It's an audio book. Dan Carlen does an incredible job of going just deep enough to avoid heavy editorializing while pointing out where you can go deeper. He usually cites multiple sources for everything he says with a preference for first hand accounts and multiple perspectives (i.e. German and Brittish soldiers at Passchendaele). It's well worth it.

15959,"The most important events in history are generally pretty goddamn dirty. A lot of seminal events in the human timeline involve war, conflict, genocide, disease, famine, or natural disasters, whether we like it or not. Understanding how violent humans have been historically, and how we've railed against changing norms that are actively damaging or threatening our species is probably the single most important part of history because that's what lets us avoid said mistakes and patterns in the future.

Theoretically. 

But people don't want to learn the dirty shit about history, so they're shocked when it happens to them because history does indeed have a habit of spiraling around itself."
15960,"I'm not sure how that's a problem? By modern I'm not talking start with current events. I mean start with, for US history, things like 9/11 and the lead up to the Iraq war, the 2008 financial crisis, the Black Lives Matter and related movements, the steep partisan divisions, etc. ask why from there. Why did we invade Iraq? That gives you, among other things, why were we so involved in the Middle East. That lets you start talking about the Cold War era, relations with the Soviets, etc. that leads you to the role we played following WW2, that leads to talking about the causes of WW2 and the aftermath of ww1, etc. 

That's all very useful history to explain why our world is the way it is. Which should be the goal of teaching history.

But instead we learn a bunch of details that make for interesting narratives, but not necessarily better education and never get past the civil war era which, while still important and at times relevant, doesn't influence nearly as much as all the events of the 20th century."
15961,"I think a teacher remaining neutral in a government class is how they should teach the class. That being said, I never had a teacher ignore terrible acts or the government being way out of line even in recent times. heck I think if I were still in I'd be writing a paper on abortion access right now. A huge part of my government work was current event type stuff. There's not an ""intended"" thing by schools to limit current event knowledge like you claim, there are just disconnects, gaps in knowledge, bad teachers, bad administrators, but there isn't this overarching movement to keep current events out of the curriculum, at least not yet but it is under more and more attack by these book burning idiots everywhere"
15962,"Especially with the abridged version taught in US schools.  It's pitched as 'Good vs Evil', in that there were the 'liberators of Europe and liberators of the Jews vs genocidal maniacs' 

But we don't learn about MS St. Louis, nazi pep rally's at Madison Square Garden, etc.  

In reality, it was more like 'Those who saved European Jewry and European independence once they had to for their own preservation vs genocidal maniacs'. So it was less 'Good vs Evil' and more like 'Less Evil and Ambivalent for as long as possible vs Evil'

I'm being cheeky but it's also factual."
15963,"Bro what.

WWII and the creation of the atomic bomb is a massive part of the American mythos. The Manhattan Project? Oppenheimer? And then the following Cold War where nuclear annihilation was the big fear? Have you ever met an American?"
15964,Hydrogen bombs?
15965,"If you asked a hundred American public high school kids to find Canada on a map 75% would struggle, but that's because they're *dumb*, not because they're not taught."
15966,"I think that upon seeing what the Imperial Japanese were doing to the civilian populations and to their own soldiers, the atomic bombs were an unfortunate necessity. The longer the US waited, the more chances the Imperial Japanese forces would have to do to other people what they had already done to Singapore. The atomic bombs also were better than the alternative: the continual fire bombing on all of their very flammable cities. 

There's no way to say the atomic bombs weren't terrible. But they were hardly an atrocity when you saw what got you there. The entire Pacific front was a nightmare and picking just two bombs out of it as ""atrocities"" undermines just what it took to get to that point in the war."

15970,"I have *much* less of a problem with Carlin or the podcast than with the distorted place he/it holds in the minds of many fans. I think he could do more to discourage it, but he's not wrong for doing the project insofar as he acknowledges sincerely that it isn't rigorous scholarship.

To borrow/rebut your chess analogy, I can't even imagine resenting that: they like playing chess, they like streaming while they do it, and people like watching them--awesome! What I would find grating is a fan who goes around thinking they could take a game off Pia Cramling or whoever because they've watched every video by some 1800-rated streamer. If a *ton* of that streamer's viewers started sounding like that, I might wonder if there's a problem with the way they represent themselves on stream. This is basically how I feel about a lot of HH fans: they show up thrilled with the spicy, secret learnings they've discovered, ready to drop bombs on their unaware friends, and don't show even the first hint of awareness that parts of his narrative or sources might completely contradict current scholarly consensus, rather than just being jazzed up or ""filled in"". Part of engaging with any text is having a reasonable sense of how reliable it is, and I think *many* HH fans are way off base on their estimates."
15971,">His popularity says a lot more than the criticisms of a few historians.

Yes! It says very loudly that many people have great appetite for a well-produced narrative that makes them feel smart when they're done. Same premise as half of all documentary podcasts (and NPR shows). But, like many of those, while Carlin might be a skilled minor leaguer in researching the content, *consuming* it is firmly the rec league of studying history. Again, that's not bad! Most people will have more fun doing that, and learning some stuff is almost always better than learning no stuff. But it's concerning when people seem to assume that all of his narratives are at least right *in spirit,* when there are often grave reservations about that among people doing the primary research.

(Also, I don't think it's ""a few"" historians; I think there are a few who are grouchy and argumentative enough to yell about it in public, but I'm pretty sure many of the rest just don't think there's much value in fighting pop history battles and keep their noses in their books)"
15972,"I am an actual historian. Yes, it does matter. You can't just 'smooth out' events to make it more entertaining because you have misrepresented what *actually* happened. History is complicated, and the moment you simplify it you are flirting with bad history and problematic revisionism. Maybe that's fine for the general public, but the moment you are seen as a voice of historical authority intentionally or no it becomes problematic. Popular history in general also has a problem with engaging with historiography in a way consistent with rigorous academic methods.

Now, I don't have a problem with non-academic historians doing the work of historians. If they can apply the aforementioned rigorous academic methods to their work and stand up to peer review then there is no reason why they shouldn't be taken seriously. The problem with Carlin is that his work doesn't stand up to peer review, and while his listeners often see his ""taking the middle path"" between different academic interpretations as pragmatic, in reality he is crafting a brand new interpretation without putting in the research necessary to make it work. *That* is why academic historians are in general very wary of him."

I listen to the Dollop sometimes, but I don't like it quite as much. Some of the bits go on too long for my taste. They can beat a dead horse on BtB sometimes too, so maybe its just because that's the one I started listening to first.

16001,"They started a podcast called worst year ever in 2020 and it was about election stuff and then covid happened and it really did become the worst year ever

They ran it into 2022 and stopped, likely because as mentioned Robert is very busy with BTB and it could happen here, and Katie and Cody are busy with some more news and even more news

16003,Cody got me into BtB through their Ben Shapiro episodes. They read his novel over the course of 8 random episodes throughout the year. The amount of disdain Katy shows for Ben grows each episode and Cody acts more and more like a crate of shook up soda bottles about to explode.

Alright. 

Malone didn't invent or even significantly develop mRNA tech, in 1989 he simply made a small, failed at the time, contribution by experimenting with adding mRNA to a living mouse's cells to create a protein. The problem there is it worked, but he couldn't get the mouse's immune system to respond. He *never* even published this work and shelved the idea of continuing experiments using mRNA to work on vaccines using DNA. None of those were much of a success either. 

Since then, many maaany scientists/doctors have made much more substantial contributions into the development of mRNA vaccines. 

If anything, Katalin Kariko is the one who has earned the claim. And this is one of the many who did exactly what Malone claimed to do and did it better.

And that's just based on his first claim! 

One of his next claims is the patents.

As far as the mRNA patents go, he is telling the truth. Sort of. Half truth.

Malone does have mRNA patents. Actually true. But again, half truths. He has patents that go as far as what he developed, which aren't even used in modern mRNA technology, *and they're expired.*

Only an idiot would take what he says as fact and not look more into it.

I do agree that the first few were rough, generally speaking. I feel he was figuring out his speaking/tonal comfort during these."

16084,"Understandable really. You hear 'engineering disaster podcast', and you assume it's going to be fairly dry, technical and relatively concise. Like say, an episode of Fascinating Horror or Plainly Difficult.

This definitely isn't that, and it's not everyone's cup of tea. Basically, you usually need to skip like 25 minutes to get at the actual topic. And they tend to run quite long.

Largely benefited middle/upper class families who wouldn't be producing children that would turn to crime."
16094,"I agree. I like his work for the most part but I definitely force myself to question a lot of what he discusses. Sometimes I think either his own biases are coming through or perhaps he refuses to give the benefit of the doubt when he should. The freakanmomics ep felt a little aggressive, but maybe that's because I also loved the book at the time and it's where I learned about sunk cost fallacy (although maybe it was through their podcast, it's been so long) which wound up being useful information for me.

Of course you'll get absolutely no replies from any of the people that feel called out by your truthful message, but have a, ""You posted what needed to be posted, thanks,"" from me."
16106,How do we determine who is or isn't obese?
16107,"You are looking at being fat as an individual choice instead of a series of failures by society to provide meaningful options to those suffering from obesity. The point is that we blame people for eating bad when we as a society make everything that makes eating right challenging. Meat and corn are heavily subsidized while fruits and vegetables aren't, thus foods with lots of salt, sugar, and corn syrup (all of which have proven to be addictive) are way cheaper than food high in fiber. Long commutes encourage buying food instead of cooking yourself, and the barrier entry for cooking means poor people and those that are homeless can't afford to do it. That's without even touching on Food Deserts and the like or how little time and energy many have to exercise after sitting all day working."
16108,"I seriously worry that this is going to become the dominant narrative in society as the average person becomes obese.  But I've been there (morbidly obese), I'm sure as hell not going back, and if I can take a few fatties with me and show them the light, good."
16109,Lot of delusional people in here. Simply being made aware that being fat is unhealthy is too much for them
16110,"We could talk about this all day, but all the stuff you're bringing up is literally addressed in that episode I linked."
16111,"It really just boils down to understanding that everyone cannot, nor should be expected to, put the same amount of effort into their bodies, and that people don't need to weigh in on other people's bodies. 

FWIW, I'm a cishet middle class white lady who has also taken herself from overweight to normal weight for her height (165 to 120lbs) and kept it off for 5 years through CICO. I am a statistical outlier, and I understand that I am a statistical outlier. I also know it's possible for some people, and I am an example. But I also am aware of the systems that I used that allowed me to do that successfully, and I know those systems and privileges don't exist for everyone. I also lost weight initially unhealthfully and have struggled to adjust the eating habits I built through just paying attention to CICO. The maintenance phase is the diet, and is the hardest part, and is not just down to the individual, and is the whole point of the podcast."
16112,The biggest indicator for covid death was being single. Are you shaming everyone to get married?
16113,"But the reality is that doctors don't like investigating anything that is ""hard."" If they don't have an answer come to them in your 15 minute appointment, they will send you off with a good luck. If you're fat, this effect is 10x worse because it's so easy to pick weight as the cause for literally anything. It should not be a first line treatment because lifestyle changes take a long time to see results (on the off chance it'll even help with the patient's symptoms) while a serious problem would get much worse in the meantime. If fat people aren't getting their medical needs met, of course they're going to be sicker and be more likely to die. 

I was at a neurologist looking with him at a scan of my brain injury and I asked when I could expect to start feeling better and he said I needed to lose weight because that was actually causing my symptoms. Spoiler alert: I felt better when the brain injury healed."
16114,"So you'd be cool if you were let's say, going to the doctor for bleeding out of your anus and going over the basics he asked if you smoked. You say yes and he says ""Well, quit smoking and let's see if that fixes the bleeding out of the anus thing. Come back in 3 months.""

You'd be good with that?"
16115,Name the country that has lowered its level of obesity at the population level without a war or famine.
16116,"That all makes complete sense, but I truly don't think they are capable of going to the source (the literature) to back up any claims or qualms they may have. So they have to be getting their information from somewhere down the daisy chain that you described. I'd be concerned their implicit bias is going to lead them to promote information that is incorrect in a way they don't understand."
16117,"Have you listened to much of it? That's not really the message I get from it. Most of what they talk about is way more nuanced than that. 

I see them as being opposed to the idea that EVERYONE can lose weight sustainably, and that EVERYONE can/should do it in any specific way. I see them as being opposed to the idea that losing weight is a moral imperative and being fat makes you a bad/lazy/selfish person. They are *constantly* affirming the fact that they aren't there to tell anyone how to live their lives, and noting that they don't go around ""well actually""-ing the people in their lives who are on diets."
16118,Oh hell. Of course it's him.
16119,It sounds like a terrible gender stereotype but I think You're wrong about worked cuz Hobbes brought the research and Marshall brought the empathy.  None of there new shows have that balance.

16123,I was so full of info by the end and so worked up about it. I ended up writing a play about World War 1 and producing it in my city for the centennial in 2018. I've never been moved by something I learned enough to do that before.

16129,"The way he seamlessly talks about the big picture before zooming into the human account on the ground in a specific place and moment in time is astonishing. 

He turns something that's taught at an arms length and conceptual in school to something genuinely real and in a way that you *feel* that these people went through and that, in reality, they're not so different to you or I.

Even in his series about the various ancient histories he still manages to make you realise that humans now and 1000 years or more ago are really no different in their core. We all aspired, loved, felt loss, had regret, made mistakes, felt pain and all the other things."
16130,I thought the blueprint for Armageddon episodes were free. Maybe it was just a promotion?
16131,Thank you!
16132,"Don't think too bad about yourselves in the USA (? I assume, unless you really meant the american continents in general): I and many of my friends also have little knowledge of history, despite having quite seriously done and quite good history lessons in public schools : I just didn't pay attention, focusing on other subjects, and now years later I really regret it as it is a fascinating and very important knowledge to have, and I struggle trying to read about stuff knowinf that I lack the background knowledge to better understand it and thus better remember it."
16133,"I was actually talking about this with my dad this week! I have a pet theory what's killed off so much empathy for others' suffering in the world is the lack of the nasty bits of history being taught at the human level. 

When I was in school 15 years ago, we spent *weeks* on periods of ancient history, and by the time we got to the industrial revolution, there was so little time left in the school year that we would just not talk about most of the high points. 


Fortunately, I love 20th century history for whatever reason, and I had access to fantastic libraries, so I went out and read about the things that were skipped over, like *the fucking Holocaust*. Not everybody has that drive or that kind of access to after school resources.

I remember Blueprint for Armageddon being so hard to listen to, but damn did it open my eyes."
16134,Or they do learn the dirty shit and use it as a guidebook for power and money. So there's that.
16135,"Because history takes a couple generations to figure out. 9/11 is only 21 years off. 

Cold war yeah that's starting to be understood and talked about.

16136,Up until the late 30 and even into the invasion of poland the US and its PEOPLE supported the nazis.
16137,"Creating the weapons and having them as a deterrent, yes. I actually do remember learning about mutually assured destruction. But actually using them? I bet you a lot of Americans don't think we've ever actually used weapons of mass destruction considering what a big fucking deal we make about other countries not even having them.

16138,"Oh that's funny. I was literally just watching Lost last night. Which, spoiler alert there's a hydrogen bomb. Editing my post."
16139,"Japan was already on the cusp of surrender. The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was the US flexing military might. The US military did not really believe it was necessary. It turns out the stories Truman told about how many lives were saved and the invasion that was avoided were fake.

If they wanted to make a statement to Japan, they could've nuked the countryside. Bombing cities wasn't a threat aimed at Japan. It was a threat aimed at the rest of the world."
16140,"Yeah. I was 2002, so maybe things changed with the extra years, but I think district and individual teacher probably have a lot more to do with it."

16143,"I've heard historians complain about him getting stuff wrong a few times, but to be fair to the guy he's usually (usually) pretty good at letting the audience know when he's going off-book and just wildly speculating for the fun of it."
16144,"I'd be careful about the askhistorians posts regarding Carlin too, many of them do exactly what they accuse him of doing. They take bits of his podcast out of context and use it to construct a particular narrative. I remember one of their criticisms quoted a bit of one of his podcasts but conveniently left out the fact that prefaced the bit they quoted with a warning that the little side story he was about to tell was heavily disputed but he was telling it for entertainment value. And that's the thing with Carlin, he's not a historian he's an entertainer and he's completely honest about that. One of the main criticisms askhistorians has with him is that he can't help himself when it comes to interesting but dubious stories but the thing is when he tells a dubious story he's always honest about it. He has stated his main goal is to interest people in a topic and hopefully inspire them to read further and develop an interest in history and I'd say he's damn successful at that."
16145,You could arguably call the english civil war a rather drawn out coup d'etat.

A quote from a local journalist that was talking about headlines in German papers. So the German papers were wrong? 

> ""And today, what makes Bonn so attractive for lots of people, including newly privatized, major companies like Deutsche Post and Deutsche Telekom is that all of that infrastructure that Bonn lucked into getting when it was the capital of West Germany - the subway, the international school, you know, all that stuff - that's what now makes Bonn such a nice place to live.""

That's not calling it a boomtown. And what's inaccurate about that statement?"
16148,"The whole thing was so derangedly transparent and amateurish, I listened to the podcast throughout a few gym sessions and it made it really hard to get my workouts done. I was *howling* at times.

My favourite moments were when the hosts would fixate on otherwise minor linguistic choices, like when Ben mentions illegal immigrants being ""of gang age"" or the black kid with the dead eyes. On one hand they're all screaming signs of really problematic internalized racism and on the other sometimes he really shows how hilariously limited his prose and even his basic grammar are, considering most of his work is done with words, spoken or written.

Kissinger though, he'd be whoever you wanted him to be. Women wanted him to be a respectful and charming date, so he was. Men wanted him to brag about his sexual conquests so he did. Leaders in the Middle East wanted him to be an antisemite and so he was."

16176,"I listened to Amnesty once because I only saw there were only 5 episodes and I was interested in listening to a DnD podcast, so I picked what I thought was a short one. I was instantly hooked and thrilled to find out there were much more episodes. Then after that I went to balance. Incredible storytelling."

16178,"I haven't really loved any TAZ since balance, bit I really am enjoying steeplechase.   Justin is really enjoying doing dumb stuff and its hilarious."
16179,I listened to Balance but not much else in the back catalog. I listened to and enjoyed Ethersea as it was coming out. I'm only a couple of episodes into Steeplechase and I'm not quite hooked but I think I just need another episode or two to get into the story.
16180,"This is why I don't bother reading anything from fans around media - it can never end well. I enjoy Rings of Power, I enjoy TAZ, I don't need to be validated around this. Any time you end up in a conversation online about this stuff you get miserable negativity like your comment. Sad."
16181,"Yeah! Another person commented that DnDaddies sucks because ""they don't even play DND anymore, they barely rolled one die in one episode"", and while every one is entitled to their own opinion, that's what makes it so fun! They're friends having fun making a story, joking around and interacting as characters! It's exactly what I want to listen to!"
16182,"I once saw a band guy (I think it was Clutch) say that fans are freaky because they frequently end up knowing more about you and your band than you know yourself, somehow.

Once you have a critical mass of fans that have more investment in a work than the creator, if it hasn't been given to a huge corporation that can shrug off fans, it tends to break down completely because now the fans seemingly have more power than the creators do.

Combine this with how it very often coincides with the creatives starting to run low on novel ideas or have largely finished fleshing out the work, and you can almost pinpoint the moment something is doomed before its fully dead.

The closest I ever called one was Welcome to Nightvale, around the time they put a dragon on trial. Despite it being a top 10 podcast and constantly recommended when I started it, after I put it down I've heard it mentioned maybe once in the 6 or 7 years since then. And if it's in this thread it's at the bottom lol"
16183,"Same, I also laughed so hard that I almost passed out so it was sort of a win/lose situation though. 

Also separately from that I was blessed to be at the Adventure Zone live show where they did Lords of Crunch, a lot less of the negative side of the fandom showed up for that though"

16194,That was one sentence...
16195,You are putting everyone in one bag. I never said ANYTHING about my views nor did I watch podcast.
16196,actually no. the evidence that Joe Rogan and all of his fans are morons is everything they say and do. QED
16197,"what evidence? when someone above tried to argue anything to do with numbers (they said the claim that joes had hundreds more experts than crazy people is wrong because hes had way more than 10 psychos on) people just said ""im not gonna engage with this"" which just means they dont have a good argument"
16198,I think saying alex jones was right about sandy hook cancels that out personally
16199,"That's him being anti-establisment, not really about him being left or right leaning."
16200,"sorry if confused anyone, wasnt saying joe said those things about gay/trans people, was saying that alex jones did.  the clip of joe calling people who went after him for sandy hook a liberal cult and saying he was right was on tim pools podcast (the bonus possibly,  he was also in main, but this statment im not sure if it happened there ) with joe alex tim and blaire white right after alexs court case ended for sandy hook. This may be selfish of me, but I dont wanna go threw hours of tim pool talking about how every american should be able to own a nuclear warhead and alex jones talking about how the democrats are turning both people and frogs trans (these both come up in the podcast, though the warhead one may be a diff episode) for this clip."
16201,"As a liberterian and a ex pod watcher, I dont think that disliking joe for doing stuff like going on a podcast with alex jones (a guy that calls for the murder of democrats and gays) is some thinly veiled hatered of liberterians, and anyone that thinks that is the most reddit liberterian ever."
16202,"Wow, you just educated yourself on product placement, and now I don't have to go back and forth with you!"
16203,"You sent a google search link and act like it's an argument. There's no game, either support your opinion with examples like an adult or don't pretend to have an argument."
16204,"Saying ""I was given a drug by a doctor"" isn't the same as saying ""you should take a drug"". This is obvious.   

And tbh I'm not in a position to criticize the physician treatment of a patient, and I have little confidence that you are, either.   

The simple fact is that Rogan doesn't give any medical advice aside from basic diet and exercise recommendations. Any attempt to claim otherwise is an exercise in futility and just demonstrates willful ignorance in pursuit of a CNN narrative."
16205,"You're first line in this ""comeback"" is annoying. Throwing at somebody ""well you go do it then"" is just stupid logic. By that thinking, no one should be allowed to criticize anything unless they can personally do the task themselves. Good thing being a critic isn't a profession. Would be bad if someone had to tell them to apply by your big brain logic over here. 

It also makes you come off as someone who doesn't know how to defend their point of view/belief. There's also a lot of passing the buck there too. I bet you stand up everyday to mass media and it's various messengers without being lead astray. If I only we all could become as free a thinker as you."

16218,"Do they get more into the facts eventually? I'm not really looking for a full on lecture tbh. I'm definitely more interested in a 50/50 split of actual information and jokes.

But honestly that's not really what the pod is about.  It's more on the issues with certain diets, issues that crop up with being overweight (doctors/medical care), and trying to have healthier relationships with food.  
  
  
The episodes on ""weight loss"" products/bars are hilarious imo"
16224,"It's not that it's bullshit, it's more than it's relying on two important things to actually work:

1. Knowing how many calories go out 
2. And how many go in 

For the 1st point, there are a lot of variables, from metabolism, health conditions to lifestyle. For example, which calculation are you using to know how many calories you need to consume? Are you sure that your 5km run used up 500 calories? There are really a lot of factors that can make this number wildly vary from person to person. 

For the 2nd point mainly labeling can be wrong and how you count can be wrong (do you weight everything or do you take shortcuts and just approximate?), but also having to count/weight your food can lead to some eating disorders."
16225,Cico is not *required* for weight loss. That's the thing.
16226,"I'll listen to it but it's not going to change my mind that I don't want my loved one struggling with type 2 diabetes and heart issues which are directly related to her weight. I don't fat shame- we all have our own lives to live but that will never stop me from wanting her to have an easier life and a joyful life. She has told me herself she eats to alleviate depression and she is depressed about her obesity, health issues and mobility problems."
16227,"Since she put on this weight she has had to deal with diabetes according to her Dr.- brought on by her diet. She has heart issues and told me herself that the heavier she gets the more episodes and more severe atrial defib. I think she is killing herself. She eats because of depression and admits her obesity feeds her depression. 
I read two of those many linked articles and both brought up type 2 diabetes and heart issues with obesity. The one article said obese people live longer than smokers- so fucking what? I hate that some of my loved ones smoke too."
16228,"You just directly quoted me and then immediately rephrased my quote into something I didn't say.  

Saying something could be better doesn't mean it's bad now. One of the people I referenced earlier was a mother who did a great job raising 2 kids. She had a good life in her 30s-early 40s. But she's almost a different person now at 50, having lost half her weight. I don't ask her any questions, she talks about it quite openly, how much losing that weight has positively impacted her life. It's blown her away, that, this late in life, she's been able to change so much. 

You're trying to position yourself like you're morally better than me, but so far you've yelled at me for saying a bunch of shit I didn't say, and then you perverted my words to try and make me look bad.

You seem like a really dishonest, unethical person."
16229,"This is the silliest take here that is [incredibly easy to research on your own](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=reasons+why+people+can't+lose+weight) (eg, many medical conditions, medications, genetics, malabsorption of nutrients and many, MANY more). If you want to hate fat people, so be it. But it is 100% untrue that ""losing weight is literally always possible at any point in life."" How dumb are you?"

16231,"I think it can feel that way for a lot of people because of the myth of calories in calories out.  Yeah it works that way if you are a young healthy person, but I am going through menopause. Calorie restriction alone no longer works at all. Worse is that now I feel like I have pms cravings all the time. I crave sugar like a fiend so not only am I hungry I'm miserable because hormonal cravings are the worst. 

The only thing that has been working is keto which is incredibly restrictive when all you feel like eating are sweets, pasta, bread and potatoes. 

It's cruel what nature does to a woman's body and even more cruel what society does to it.   And of course I am 100% responsible but that doesn't mean it's easy and often feel impossible. 

My  unsolicited advice is if you are under 30, get moving, get fit, build muscle because once you hit 50 you will carry the consequences of a sedentary life on your chest (or belly) and getting fit and healthy takes way more work.   Take care of your body before it's too late."

16234,"I am fat because of bad choices I have made. Does society have something to do with that? Sure, the stuff you said is true, the availability of shitty addictive food is a huge problem, and education about what we _should_ be eating is terrible.

But... I know all of that, and I don't live in a food desert, so. It's my fault that I'm fat. Not society's.

I can't imagine I am a special unique flower, so there are plenty of people like me who are to blame for their own fatness, and hiding behind the comfort of ""all fat people are blameless! It's society's fault!"" isn't going to help us drop the weight."
16235,"So, at what point does taking some personal responsibility for your own body fit into this equation? Everything you have stated here are reasons why it's easy to be fat in America. Fat people deserve to be treated and respected as human beings, obviously. That doesn't mean you look at someone living an unhealthy lifestyle and tell them that they're making the right choices. Because they aren't. 

Take a look at the countless people who changed their lifestyle, made a little more effort to eat healthy food, exercise, and limit their portions. And how much happier they are because of it. 

Some people will always be a bit on the larger side and others more slim, but there isn't an excuse to be morbidly obese."
16236,[deleted]
16237,"> Meat and corn are heavily subsidized while fruits and vegetables aren't, thus foods with lots of salt, sugar, and corn syrup (all of which have proven to be addictive) are way cheaper than food high in fiber.

We must go to very different grocery stores... When I go grocery shopping produce is the absolute cheapest section. Fresh and frozen fruits and veggies, beans, potatoes and rice, are dirt cheap. Meat is the most expensive. Dairy is expensive. Alcohol is expensive, as are soda and juice (I went shopping yesterday and a 12 pack of coke was $9. For the same price I could get 2 lbs brown rice, 2lbs onions, 2 lbs tomatoes and a bell pepper). The Mediterranean Diet is cheaper than the Standard American diet."
16238,"My friend, if the average person is considered clinically obese, that is the definition of systemic. If the average person makes less money than they did twenty years ago, do you think it'd be reasonable to say people are straight up arent interested in being financially stable? If more people were being murdered now than twenty years ago would you say people are less interested in being safe? 

The point is, society is structured in such a way that the barrier for entry is often too high for many people. That is WHY this issue is prevalent- not because people randomly stopped giving a shit about their quality of life. They work harder, for longer hours, sometimes multiple jobs with long commutes and for less financial gain as prices have risen (groceries have gone up almost 30 percent in some areas just since 2020 alone). This is a truth for the AVERAGE PERSON. When you also need to find time to cook healthy, balanced meals and exercise, the result is that the effort is often not a sustainable reality, and people will default back to what works for them, which absolutely makes sense. There is a reason your likelihood for being obese is better predicted by your zipcode than your genetics- your odds increase the poorer you are- if it wasn't a socioeconomic relationship, we wouldn't be seeing things like this. 

This isn't to absolve people of personal accountability- we all have to do what's best for us in our own lives. In a world where there was no standardized public education some people still learned how to read. But A LOT MORE people could read when there was public initiative and infrastructure. I know this might be a wild concept but when you make healthy choices more accessible... more people can access them. And if someone is having difficulty doing this, it's inherently ignorant to point the finger solely at them when there is tons of public policy and lobbying dollars working against them. Its not fun being fat in the world- it isn't built for you and people are mean. There are people who have Phds who struggle with weight, people who work multiple jobs, people who've raised whole families - willpower is not the silver bullet you think it is. If you care about this, and sincerely want people to move in a direction you feel has been life changing, you might better inform yourself about why so many people are stuck, and start there rather than assume everyone's life looks like yours simply because at one point you shared a clothing size."
16239,"Yeah? I'm in the middle of reading it and it is, as most podcasts are, garbage and wasteful joking and talking rather than getting to the point.

So far all I've gotten is that ""calories in, calories out,"" is 100% true, but the podcasters don't want to admit that so they have to worm around it without being able to call it fake (because then they'd be lying), they just heavily imply it so that a listener comes away with the idea it's fake even though it is true.

Like with basketball, you literally win if you score more points. They're right that it's very generic advice that won't tell an individual how they can individually get to their goal, but even the podcasters can't say it's not true.

So, while, sure, it's not totally linear. It's still broadly true. Which is why it's still used."
16240,"The irony of your comment is that you didn't actually talk whatsoever in this entire thread, you just said the podcast says some stuff, never said what, and then couldn't even back it up..."
16241,"Yes and no, most people can control themselves and make informed decisions. The problem is that they do not and somehow we've come to handwave all that away and claim people have little to no control.

That just isn't true, if it was, then we wouldn't be experiencing the rising rates of obesity that's been occuring over the past 80 or so years.

When you go to McDonald's you do NOT have to get the soda, or the hamburger with the secret sauce, or the extra salt on the fries. You can make meal plans that allow you to stay within a more healthy range of nutrition.

This rising rate of obesity is causing a rise in healthcare expense. So, actually, we do need to weigh in on other people's bodies. Their poor health decisions are bringing society down, yet it seems that some people want to excuse fat people's poor decisions and just say HAES, and that we should just be accepting of every body, and whatever else.

Like, sure, we shouldn't just be spitting in people's faces, but we also shouldn't be sweeping the issue under the rug and make excuses for why we shouldn't address it."
16242,That's factually wrong. Don't justify obesity.
16243,"That's the metric you're deciding to work with? You don't see any flaws in that reasoning? Virtually everyone can lose weight on their own, most people don't want to put in the effort."
16244,Doesn't this prove that most people can lose weight. A country in say South America begins to get American processed foods and gains weight due to the fact that the foods contain many calories without being that filling. Therefore if people went back to eating in the traditional way which is possible to do they lose weight. I understand in the US food deserts are an issue but there are literally tons of fat people in the US who don't live in food deserts and can afford to eat healthy. Those people should be accountable for their weight and the whole Maintenance phase it's societies fault BS doesn't ultimately help anyone.
16245,">That all makes complete sense, but I truly don't think they are capable of going to the source (the literature) to back up any claims or qualms they may have. So they have to be getting their information from somewhere down the daisy chain that you described.

Honestly I think that's a totally valid concern. A big part of what they do is take information from academic literature and make it understandable for a lay audience who may not have enough of a background to understand reading a medical journal or meta-analysis on their own, and in doing so, that information definitely gets filtered through their own biases and understanding. That said, a big part of the reason I'm such a fan of their work is that I feel like they tend to be very up front when they are out of their depth and reach out to experts to help clarify things, they talk a lot about their own biases and personal histories with certain topics, and they are very transparent with their agenda (getting society to treat fat people with respect and dignity). I've always (personally) gotten the impression that they are always trying to engage with these topics in good faith. I would also never treat one of their episodes as equivalent to an actual academic paper, study, or meta-analysis. In the end it's informative entertainment and should be treated as such. They do provide links to their sources in their show notes though if you want to track down what they reference in the episodes.

If you haven't checked it out for yourself, they will be able to make the case for their points of view far better than I could. If you're looking for suggestions for good episodes to start with, I'm a big fan of their episode about [Snake Oil](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/snake-oil/id1535408667?i=1000507558767), which is kind of a history of patent medicine and is a little more fun and low stakes than some of their other episode (plus it has a fun twist). The episode about [Moon Juice](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/moon-juice/id1535408667?i=1000498139776) is also pretty funny. Their episode on [Zombie Statistics](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/zombie-statistics-spectacular/id1535408667?i=1000558016260) is also very informative in interesting.

And if you listen to it and it's not for you, or you already have and you already know you don't like it, that's okay too. Everything isn't for everybody. I'm a huge fan and there are still episodes I'm pretty critical of."

16255,"That's not at all what I've read and heard. The trend the military leaders saw upon taking the outer islands of Japan was horrific and the prospect of what it would look like for the actual mainland was terrifying. The Imperial Japanese citizens were essentially preparing bamboo spears and pointed brooms in a Churchillian way of taking someone with them. Their citizens' army was only half the tragedy as you had prisoners of war and citizens in occupied countries like Korea to worry about as the Japanese were beginning to execute people as they left places like Singapore. 

Couple that with what we found out from Imperial Japan's military leaders about how they viewed they should go down fighting. You had one general say something to the effect of wouldn't it be nice if Imperial Japan went out like a burning petal. Then you had the attempted coup for when the emperor of Japan tried to finally surrender. 

To say Imperial Japan was on the verge of surrender is just ignorant. Tell that to their army which was still beating China like a drum and completely confused why they should surrender when they thought they were winning. 

When continuous fire bombings (which were arguably more horrific and contributed more deaths) wouldn't persuade the Imperial Japanese to surrender, you needed a knock out blow. Yeah, it flexes military might. But what in god's name would the alternative have looked like? A land invasion? That already was being prepared, but no one was looking forward to it because of the kind of fighting they'd already seen on islands like Okinawa. Do you blockade them as a lot of people like to suggest? Well that opens up a whole list of humanity crises where now you are denying the citizens of Japan medicine, food, etc. 

From a country that would not back down, it is incredibly difficult to think that Imperial Japan would have ever surrendered if the war kept going like it was. No one just came to that war in 1941 and thought ""let's commit some horrific war events today."" It took 4 years of the most gruesome, dogged fighting you will ever see or read about to get to the point that dropping an atomic bomb was the least insane idea. You can not like atomic weapons, but I'm not sure that war would have ended any nicer than how it had."
16256,"Which part? I'll grant most listeners probably don't think they could go out and *write* history afterward, but they're definitely misled about how much they understand relative to someone who went and read the actual literature with a critical eye - they don't even know what they don't know, because they write and believe things like ""Dan Carlin is the truth"". That's not a strawman, unless that user is made of straw. You seent it right in front of you. You may disagree that that there are enough of those listeners to matter, but I've found it to be a pretty common attitude. If our experiences are too different to agree on that, then probably we're working from incompatible premises and that's why this isn't going anywhere."
16257,"The problem is that no matter how much he might say he's not a historian and that he's going to go ""off-book"" or whatever, people still treat him and his podcast as authoritative. In my opinion, there is no room for wild speculation when you have an audience of millions who believe that what they are getting is ""hardcore history"" and not the speculation of a non-expert. This is not something that would be acceptable in a hard science like physics or medicine, but because people treat history the same way they do stories of fiction pop history producers are not held to the high standards that they should be. This is an issue compounded by how lousy academic historians are at communicating with the public compared to the most popular science ambassadors like Carl Sagan. To be fair to us historians, however, history is so much more complicated and messy compared to the hard sciences."

But when I mentioned above that I knew people who'd lost a ton of weight and transformed their lives, two of the  people I was thinking of were women in their early 50s. Both lost about HALF their weight. 

You can just look at the obesity rates in America over time, and it's clear that either (a) our species is evolving at an unprecedented rate to be fatter or (b) obesity is a cause of our lifestyles, not our genetics. 

Keto diets, by the way, don't really perform better than other diets in controlled studies. 

A year ago at this time I was on my own weight-loss journey, to lose 25lbs of fat. It took me over 5 months. Sometimes odd little things helped. One of the little things that really did seem to help me break through a plateau was this: drink only warm water or warm tea."

16306,"Replied to someone else the same way but I'm with you, man. I used to be clinically morbidly obese, and lost a ton of weight when I was a kid and it absolutely changed my life for the better.

16309,"But why do you need to comment on people's lifestyle choices? 

I think the point being made is that in order to actually do something about obesity at a societal level you have to consider societal changes. Far too much focus is currently on telling overweight people to ""make a little more effort"" and not on regulation of the food system. This is encouraged by the food companies and lobbyists who would much rather it remained a ""personal responsibility"" issue so they didn't have to do anything about it."
16310,"> You could use this argument for a lot of societal issues.

Well, yes, that's because they are issues in the first place. Most issues are complex and can't really be solved with a single action, and to assign individual blame might make you feel better about yourself or the issue as something you have nothing to do with but that does nothing in making the issue go away, instead we could analyse the issue and come up with solutions that don't assume everyone gets lots of disposable income, get a kitchen and learn to cook, start going to the gym and walk everywhere.

No, that's not realistic nor does it do anything to tackle the issue, but by actually looking at the WHY people are like this would actually help us fix the problem:

- Why do people buy lots of bad food instead of healthy food? Cause it's cheap, addictive, easy to access, etc... 
- Why do they not exercise? Lack of time, energy, cities not meant to be walked but used with cars, etc...
- Why do they buy processed food instead of cooking? Lack of time, energy, high barrier or entry, etc...

To cross all fat people as lazy and gluttonous is just pushing the issue under the carpet and letting other people deal with it so we don't have to, and is not like all this is only for their benefit, we would all be better off if fruits and vegetables were more easily accessible, if cities were more walkable/bike friendly, if working from home was readily available so we could make our own food etc... To face this issues will lead to a better quality of life for everyone, but we can't do that until we get rid of those harmful stereotypes."

See, many particularly in the US need to develop an interest in history beyond the states.
 so while many might take a not peer review material read of history and think it's accurate, the sheer fact that it interests them may help them understand just how cautious we absolutely need to be today.

16334,I thought you didnt care? A lot of replies for someone who doesnt care
16335,"Im not going to, that wasnt what the disscusion was about. You clearly arent really thinking and are just repeating loops"
16336,Able to find the clip of Rogan agreeing with Jones about Sandy Hook?
16337,"There are no examples, because he doesn't give medical advice.   

If you want to try to produce an example I'd love to see it, otherwise this is my final reply to you."

16342,"See the thing is I'm able to listen to ideas I disagree with without absorbing them a wet sponge, if its stupid, im intelligent enough to see that. Hey, if they have a good point, what's wrong with thinking about it and challenging your preconceptions? It will only make you a better and more open-minded person. 

He has guests from every walk of life and on every side and flavour of the political spectrum. It's very easy to hate him for his guests he has on because he's had so many people on there."
16343,"If you only ever know or hear about him from what other people cover in terms of news or, 'drama,' that's to be expected. He recognizes he's spent the past couple of years being a, 'hater-ass bitch,' (his words, not mine) and is consciously working on bettering that."
16344,"Oh, I think that's philosophy enough for a personal finance sub."
16345,"Correct.  
  
  
But nutritional labels can lead to not all things being equal.  
  
  
Like, you do understand how calorie count is figured out, right?  
  
  
So you eat an entire container of tic tacs because they are 0 calories on the label.  But they are actually 1.9 calories each, and you just ate 60 of them,  so actually 114 calories. 
  
  
Or your local chicken provider doesn't inject as much water into the breasts so the weight is less water than what is measured by USDA so your 200g of chicken is closer nutritionally to 250g so there is an extra 85 calories.  
  
    
  
Again, I was saying that the podcast isn't actually for/against CICO but they just talk about diets in general and how to create healthier eating habits that are more like changes in your personal diet instead of crushing a slim fast shake every day for a month and then wondering why you still weigh the same.  They fully acknowledge and support that eating less is the simplest and easiest way to lose weight but then also discuss about how that can lead to eating disorders."
16346,"It is an empty statement. Until you explain it a little. Consuming less calories than you burn leads to weight loss, its really that simple. You cant trust labels, but the base principle is ultimately true."
16347,I don't see how that's empty. There are plenty of resources online for you to explore. As for me? I charge $1/word so let me know how you'd like to proceed.
16348,"Roughly. I eat 1 gram of fat, that's 9 kcals. If I eat 1 gram of sugar, thats 4 kcals. I have gained 1 gram of weight either way and consumed 2 different amounts of calories."
16349,[deleted]
16350,I understand that those people exist. My issue is that you are talking as if people like _me_ don't exist.

16352,"Okay, what is the thesis statement?"
16353,Just keep blaming others for your problems. That'll get you far in life.
16354,"That sounds quite different from ""functionally impossible for 90-95% of people"" to me."
16355,"You strike me as both obtuse & obese, lol."
16356,how sad
16357,"Your facts were to say that Truman's numbers were fake and you left me with an idea of attacking the country side. 

I listed a lot of reasons for why I thought the bombs were necessary. That doesn't mean I'm a fan of them or I liked them being dropped. You mentioned nuances but don't even acknowledge the conflicting dynamics I just wrote about. If you believing I've read propaganda makes you feel better, fine. 

But look up Okinawa. Look up Singapore and the Philippines. Look up the division rivalry of the Imperial Japanese army vs the navy. Look up how many kamakaze bombers were volunteers (hint, none). Look up how Imperial Japan distributed its country's manufacturing for its war machine. Look up the fire bombings of Tokyo. Tell me that there was a solution out there that anyone would have felt good about. Because the answer is that no, Imperial Japan would not have surrendered, even though anyone looking at the country at the time would have said they had lost the war already. 

I don't think there was any end that would have been pleasant, with or without atomic bombs."
16358,"Yes quoting inaccurate statements certainly shows how brillianty he did his research. Never mind the fact that his statements about the infrastructure attracting those companies is completely counterfactual. Splendid. If that's all you expect from a podcast, go crazy by all means. Why are you such a desperate fan needing to convince me of something I obviously know more about then you? The episode sucks, and you don't even recognize falsehoods when they hit you in the face.  Just move along and bother someone else."
16359,"I'm done here I don't play chess with pigeons. Go over what I wrote again, I think if you try hard you can find your own mistake."
16360,"Yea, I learned it about two years ago, from that video. Most people stay the fuck out of the chan forums for a reason. Also having outside knowledge of this topic well exceeds basically anything that could possibly be job related. If it is job related, however, your only response should be absolute fucking horror at the Chrischan stuff. It's fucking disgusting.

16367,"JRE is one of the (if not the) most popular podcasts in the world and not everyone is as intelligent as you. There are going to be a lot of people that believe the misinformation Rogan allows to be spewed on his pod without any pushback and for that reason, I dislike him."
16368,"Do you understand that if I eat nothing but peeps for a year (and miraculously don't die) I would lose weight if I ate 50% as many six months in?


Cico works if you're using it as portion control.

If you're trusting labels to make choices  you can be lead astray.

Eat sensible portions of basic foods.  Like seventeen peeps a day.  Gosh."

16370,The information is readily available if you're willing to read it.
16371,"I'm talking in aggregate, to talk about every single outlier would deviate any conversation into petty squabble, arguments about semantics and even the meaning of free will vs a society that promotes and provides additive substances to kids. Time that would be rather better spent searching for solutions for people who don't have the privilege of choice."
16372,"No, they're talking about the whole system, not any individuals.  It's not about ""people like X"" at all.  It's not about saying any individual is blameless or that it's all societies fault.  

It's recognizing that there are many, many systemic problems that lead to addiction, which makes the path to being healthy a very hard one for many.

Because that is what this is: addiction.  It's not different than smoking or drinking.  Yes, you can beat it, anyone can, though the difficulty of doing so varies from person to person. 

And it's about recognizing that for many people, their starting point is very bad because of societal problems.  This recognition is important because it's a LOT easier to be healthy and maintain a good body weight if you are through childhood.

It's not about them being blameless, because it's not about blame at all.  It's a lot easier in aggregate to fix fundamental problems that lead to this addiction and thus reduce the problem as a whole. 

That's why we have seat belts in cars and speed limits.  Why it's illegal for children to buy cigarettes and alcohol.  

As an individual, everyone is their own responsibility.  Their situation is their own, and while it's definitely not fair, it's their own responsibility.  

As a society, however, we can work to ensure a better starting point for everyone, so that fewer people start in a situation analogous to growing up in a family where literally everyone including the children smoke."
16373,"You can believe in personal responsibility all you want but at the end of the day obesity is on the raise and continues to be, and the approach of putting the onus on the individual to be healthy hasn't been working. I would rather tackle the causes of the raise in obesity at large rather than expect all fat people to start living a healthier lifestyle, specially as I already said, the solutions will bring a better QoL to everyone else."
16374,"But here's the thing, by giving out free food and encouraging people to learn to cook you are attempting to cause societal change, which is excellent! It's just strange that you are saying that fat people should feel bad for being lazy and gluttonous while acknowledging that sometimes it's an issue of access to healthy food and lack of education."
16375,I would suggest you finish listening to the episode. They tend to do a conscise summary at the end of each episode. I do believe this one is the first of a two-parter though.
16376,Are you responding to the right comment? You're not making much sense.
16377,"> Go over what I wrote again

sure and you read the three German magazines that I posted."
16378,There didn't used to be any other internet. You're just 20 odd years younger than me. Something awful was the first of its kind and predated the chans. Chris when he first appeared was a loveable oddball followed by a community of curious old internet pioneers a decade before 4chan was even born.

16383,[deleted]
16384,"Idk man it's such a weak argument when all mainstream US media is politically biased to one side of the spectrum, I'll like to say JRE is much better at giving you a neutral politically unbiased show.

Giving people a platform to be heard should never be a bad thing. Free speech only exists when you let someone you dislike say something you dislike. Im sure we can find a common ground and agree that free speech is a good thing."
16385,"You do realize that I agree with you but I'm explaining what the podcast talks about right?  They dive in on all sorts of food related facts, myths, and trends.  
  
  
I know that CICO works, I was originally responding to a posting saying that the podcast doesn't believe in CICO, which was false.  
   
   
And anyway, we all know the pink peeps make you lose weight, not the yellow ones"

16388,"Lol, just tell me what you think the thesis statement is, don't give me the run around. It makes it sound as if you don't know what you're talking about."
16389,"A.) There used to be way more stuff on the internet before everything became corporate sites. 

B.) Jfc the Chrischan stuff is so fucked up that at your age you should really understand why. If you actually know much about it, and you do ""internet safety"" you should be shouting from the rooftops about how horrible that stuff is. Like years of systematic abusing, harassment, and stalking. Why is this a hill you're dying on."

16394,">These don't have to be the brightest minds in their field doing years of research. Even if he just had a small team to read some books and do a little background research that would be SIGNIFICANTLY better than what he has now. No one is asking for achedemic research levels of background check here, just basic journalistic integrity levels of understanding who you are talking to.

Do you need like a whole hiring guide?"
16395,"But as I've explained JRE is not a ""neutral politically unbiased show"".

Jordan Peterson telling Rogan that climate change is something we don't need to worry about *is* politically biased as he works for oil-baron-funded Daily Wire.

Let's not forget that Peterson's go to author for climate science data is S. Fred Singer - a man who's climate education group is... *that's right, you guessed it*... funded by ExxonMobil, the Koch Family and the Scaife Family Foundations.

The Daily Wire and their ilk are not honest people. They are paid for by Big Oil. They lie on behalf of Big Oil. Joe Rogan allows this."
16396,"Nm, there's nothing to argue about here...  Walking away..."
16397,Did you not look at anything from that link?
16398,"I'm not here to debate you dude. This thread was for podcast recommendations. If you don't like this podcast that's fine. I'm not going to hold your hand through these episodes. If you're 100% sure you know everything there is to know about health and aren't open to any ideas that might challenge your views on it, this podcast probably isn't for you. I suggested that episode because it sounded like you might be interested in learning more about that topic. If not, that's fine. Their ultimate thesis statement over the course of the whole series is ""don't be an asshole to fat people."" If you need a Corcoran Review meta-analysis to accept that advice than you might just be a jerk and I have zero interest in talking with you about any of this further."
16399,"Yes the systemic harassment of Chris is horrific that's what the fascinating and horrifying story is. I think you have completely failed to understand why ""christorians"" follow Chris. 
Way back in the early days of the internet this oddball man appeared. At first it was just another ""look at this whacky website"" that you could share with your friends but Chris became the prototype for why its so dangerous for people with learning disabilities to have unfettered access to the interent. 
You seem to think that because I'm a longstanding follower of Chris I must be pro troll. You're completely wrong. 
Chris is arguably the most documented human in history. He is an anthropological case study in what trolls, poor parenting, a shitty school system but most of all the fucking INTERNET can do to a person. There is no shame at all in taking an interest in the story of Chris and that's why It annoyed me that BTB got things incorrect."

I was assuming it, but good to see you actually spell it out for me. You'll totally fact check him afterwards right? Right??? Totally. I'm sure.

Thankfully Joe won't be interviewing him seeing as he offed himself like such a charismatic coward."

You just want some pedantic nitpicking to excuse a millionaire from any and all responsibility by trying to make a relevitvly simple issue of ""put in effort, be responsible, know who the fuck you're talking to"" and make it into something no one can do. It's literally the bare minimum expected of good journalists. He has basically unlimited resources, he could easily hire someone to figure it out for him, if literally nothing else."

You're actually quite invested in it. 

Its a human interest story. Imagine if we took all the human Interst stories off the internet because you say its ""rubbernecking"" to take an interest in them. 
Someone got so mind broken and corrupted by trolls that they had sex with their own mother and you expect people not to take an interest but you are personally excepted from that for reasons? 
This is a new phenomenon of the digitally connected world but we mustn't document or observe it because you find it distasteful. 
OK. There's no milage here. You switched off the documentary 10 minutes in not wanting to hear any more of this filth and never gave it any further thought because you are above such base rubbernecking.

Plus I would get tired after Putin and give up considering all the fact checking I would have to do."

16429,You are again proving how you completely missed my point.
16430,"I would not watch. Unless they offered push back and debunked their guests' claims.

I can see you're very confused about this. My issue is: Joe Rogan does very little anymore to actually engage in discussion and question his guests. Take his interview with Robert Malone, for example. Did you watch/listen to that one?"
16431,[deleted]
16432,">Yes I did and Malone came off like a fool to me.

Well, at least we agree there. So you know Malone is a fool. You going to go watch him give interviews elsewhere?

So why would I watch interviews with known fools like Hitler/Putin/Dalai Lama? (really any religious authority I'm gonna doubt there, though.)

I'll tell you what, at most from that list I would look more into what the Dali Lama represents, but that's born of a curiosity towards Buddhism in general and not because of the Dali Lama himself. I don't trust him as an authority on the matter, is my point.

But Joe isn't what he used to be. I was a fan. Not anymore."
16433,[deleted]
16434,"The fuck are you talking about?

I know Putin is a war criminal and never had to watch him be interviewed on an hour or so podcast to come to that conclusion.

And my point was never even that these people aren't allowed to be interviewed, it was that *the person interviewing needs to push back against misinformation.*

It would seem you're moving the goalposts. I thought this conversation was over. Go enjoy time with your dog. Or the rest of your day. We're done, here. This isn't worth us arguing over."
